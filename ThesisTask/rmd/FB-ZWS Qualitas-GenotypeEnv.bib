abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify if genomic variations associated with fatty acid (FA) composition are similar between the Holstein-Friesian (HF) and native dual-purpose breeds used in the Dutch dairy industry. Phenotypic and genotypic information were available for the breeds Meuse-Rhine-Yssel (MRY), Dutch Friesian (DF), Groningen White Headed (GWH), and HF. First, the reliability of genomic breeding values of the native Dutch dual-purpose cattle breeds MRY, DF, and GWH was evaluated using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects estimated in HF, including all SNP or subsets with stronger associations in HF. Second, the genomic variation of the regions associated with FA composition in HF (regions on Bos taurus autosome 5, 14, and 26), were studied in the different breeds. Finally, similarities in genotype and allele frequencies between MRY, DF, GWH, and HF breeds were assessed for specific regions associated with FA composition. On average across the traits, the highest reliabilities of genomic prediction were estimated for GWH (0.158) and DF (0.116) when the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were included. With the same set of SNP, GEBV for MRY were the least reliable (0.022). This indicates that on average only 2 (MRY) to 16{\%} (GWH) of the genomic variation in HF is shared with the native Dutch dual-purpose breeds. The comparison of predicted variances of different regions associated with milk and milk fat composition showed that breeds clearly differed in genomic variation within these regions. Finally, the correlations of allele frequencies between breeds across the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were around 0.8 between the Dutch native dual-purpose breeds, whereas the correlations between the native breeds and HF were clearly lower and around 0.5. There was no consistent relationship between the reliabilities of genomic prediction for a specific breed and the correlation between the allele frequencies of this breed and HF. In conclusion, most of the genomic variation associated with FA composition in the Dutch dual-purpose breeds appears to be breed-specific. Furthermore, the minor allele frequencies of genes having an effect on the milk FA composition in HF were shown to be much smaller in the breeds MRY, DF, and GWH, especially for the MRY breed.},

abstract = {Milk yield has a strong effect on fertility, but it may vary across different herds and individual cows. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of breed and its interaction with level of milk production at the herd level (Herd-L) and at a cow-within-herd level (Cow-L) on fertility traits in dairy cattle. Data were gathered from Holstein (n = 17,688), Brown Swiss (n = 32,697), Simmental (n = 27,791), and Alpine Grey (n = 13,689) cows in northeastern Italy. The analysis was based on records from the first 3 lactations in the years 2011 to 2014. A mixed model was fitted to establish milk production levels of the various herds (Herd-L) and individual cows (Cow-L) using milk as a response variable. The interval fertility traits were interval from calving to first service, interval from first service to conception, and number of days open. The success traits were nonreturn rate at 56 d after first service, pregnancy rate at first service, and the number of inseminations. The interval from calving to first service, interval from first service to conception, and number of days open were analyzed using a Cox's proportional hazards model. The nonreturn rate at 56 d after first service, pregnancy rate at first service, and the number of inseminations were analyzed using logistic regression. There was a strong interaction between breed and productivity class at both Herd-L and Cow-L on all traits. The effects of herd and cow productivity differed from each other and differed among breeds. The dual-purpose Simmental and Alpine Grey breeds had better fertility than the specialized Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows; this difference is only partly attributable to different milk yields. Greater herd productivity can result in higher fertility in cows, whereas higher milk yield of individual cows within a herd results in lower fertility. These effects at both Herd-L and Cow-L are curvilinear and are stronger in dual-purpose breeds, which was more evident from low to intermediate milk yield levels than from central to high productivity classes. Disentangling the effects of milk productivity on fertility at Herd-L and Cow-L and taking the nonlinearity of response into account could lead to better modeling of populations within breed. It could also help with management—for example, in precision dairy farming of dairy and dual-purpose cattle. Moreover, assessing the fertility of various breeds and their different responses to herd and individual productivity levels could be useful in devising more profitable crossbreeding programs in different dairy systems.},

abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Economic values of clinical mastitis, claw disease, and feed efficiency traits along with 16 additional production and functional traits were estimated for the dairy population of the Slovak Pinzgau breed using a bioeconomic approach. In the cow–calf population (suckler cow population) of the same breed, the economic values of feed efficiency traits along with 15 further production and functional traits were calculated. The marginal economic values of clinical mastitis and claw disease incidence in the dairy system were −€70.65 and −€26.73 per case per cow and year, respectively. The marginal economic values for residual feed intake were −€55.15 and −€54.64/kg of dry matter per day for cows and breeding heifers in the dairy system and −€20.45, −€11.30, and −€6.04/kg of dry matter per day for cows, breeding heifers, and fattened animals in the cow–calf system, respectively, all expressed per cow and year. The sums of the relative economic values for the 2 new health traits in the dairy system and for residual feed intake across all cattle categories in both systems were 1.4 and 8{\%}, respectively. Within the dairy production system, the highest relative economic values were for milk yield (20{\%}), daily gain of calves (20{\%}), productive lifetime (10{\%}), and cow conception rate (8{\%}). In the cow–calf system, the most important traits were weight gain of calves from 120 to 210d and from birth to 120d (19 and 14{\%}, respectively), productive lifetime (17{\%}), and cow conception rate (13{\%}). Based on the calculation of economic values for traits in the dual-purpose Pinzgau breed, milk production and growth traits remain highly important in the breeding goal, but their relative importance should be adapted to new production and economic conditions. The economic importance of functional traits (especially of cow productive lifetime and fertility) was sufficiently high to make the inclusion of these traits into the breeding goal necessary. An increased interest of consumers in animal welfare and quality of dairy farm products should probably lead to the incorporation of health traits (clinical mastitis incidence and somatic cells score) into the breeding goal. However, keeping carcass traits in the breeding goal of the Slovak Pinzgau breed does not seem to be relevant to the long-term market situation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
