@article{Berry2017,
abstract = {Apprehension among consumers is mounting on the efficiency by which
cattle convert feedstuffs into human edible protein and energy as well
as the consequential effects on the environment. Most (genetic) studies
that attempt to address these issues have generally focused on
efficiency metrics defined over a certain time period of an animal's
life cycle, predominantly the period representing the linear phase of
growth. The age at which an animal reaches the carcass specifications
for slaughter, however, is also known to vary between breeds; less is
known on the extent of the within-breed variability in age at slaughter.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to quantify the
phenotypic and genetic variability in the age at which cattle reach a
predefined carcass weight and subcutaneous fat cover. A novel trait,
labeled here as the deviation in age at slaughter (DAGE), was
represented by the unexplained variability from a statistical model,
with age at slaughter as the dependent variable and with the fixed
effects, among others, of carcass weight and fat score (scale 1 to 15
scored by video image analysis of the carcass at slaughter). Variance
components for DAGE were estimated using either a 2-step approach (i.e.,
the DAGE phenotype derived first and then variance components estimated)
or a 1-step approach (i.e., variance components for age at slaughter
estimated directly in a mixed model that included the fixed effects of,
among others, carcass weight and carcass fat score as well as a random
direct additive genetic effect). The raw phenotypic SD in DAGE was 44.2
d. The genetic SD and heritability for DAGE estimated using the 1-step
or 2-step models varied from 14.2 to 15.1 d and from 0.23 to 0.26 (SE
0.02), respectively. Assuming the (genetic) variability in the number of
days from birth to reaching a desired carcass specifications can be
exploited without any associated unfavorable repercussions, considerable
potential exists to improve not only the (feed) efficiency of the animal
and farm system but also the environmental footprint of the system. The
beauty of the approach proposed, relative to strategies that select
directly for the feed intake complex and enteric methane emissions, is
that data on age at slaughter are generally readily available. Of
course, faster gains may potentially be achieved if a dual objective of
improving animal efficiency per day coupled with reduced days to
slaughter was embarked on.},

abstract = {Current genetic evaluations are performed separately for each breed. Multiple breed genetic evaluations, however, assume a common base among breeds, enabling producers to compare cattle of different breed makeup. Breed and heterosis effects are needed in a multibreed evaluation because databases maintained by breed associations include few crossbred animals, which may not be enough to accurately estimate these effects. The objective of this study was to infer breed effects, maternal effects, direct heterosis effects, and maternal heterosis effects for growth and carcass traits using least squares means estimates from crossbreeding studies published in the literature from 1976 to 1996. The data set was formed by recording each least squares mean along with the breed composition, maternal breed composition, and direct and maternal heterozygosity. Each trait was analyzed using a single trait fixed effect model, which included study as a fixed effect and breed composition and heterozygosity as covariates. Breed solutions for each trait were expressed relative to the Angus breed. Direct breed effects for weaning weight ranged from -7.0 +/- 0.67 kg (British Dairy) to 29.3 +/- 0.74 kg (Simmental), and maternal effects ranged from -11.7 +/- 0.24 kg (Hereford) to 31.1 +/- 2.22 kg (Gelbvieh). Direct breed effects for birth weight ranged from -0.5 +/- 0.14 kg (British Dairy) to 10.1 +/- 0.46 kg (Continental Beef), and maternal effects ranged from -7.2 +/- 0.13 kg (Brahman) to 6.0 +/- 1.07 kg (Continental Beef). Direct breed effects ranged from -17.9 +/- 1.64 kg (Brahman) to 21.6 +/- 1.95 kg (Charolais), from -6.5 +/- 1.29 kg (Brahman) to 55.8 +/- 1.47 kg (Continental Beef), from -8.1 +/- 0.48 cm(2) (Shorthorn) to 21.0 +/- 0.48 cm(2) (Continental Beef), and from -1.1 +/- 0.02 cm (Continental Beef) to 0 +/- 0.00 cm (Angus) for postweaning BW gain, carcass weight, LM area, and fat thickness, respectively. The use of literature estimates to predict direct and maternal breed and heterosis effects may supplement their direct prediction in a multibreed evaluation.},

abstract = {Beef output in the Republic of Ireland is derived from a population of circa 2.25 million cows (58{\%} dairy cows and 42{\%} suckler cows). The commercial suckler herd is predominantly crossbred with a minority pedigree population (3.5{\%}). Beef performance evaluations in the Republic of Ireland have focused on improvement in carcass traits as the breeding goal due to the volumes of data available for this trait from the commercial beef and dairy herds. In addition pedigree herds rely heavily on imported genetics and therefore cooperation with foreign evaluation centers is well established for the sharing and incorporation of foreign breeding values. In the future, participation in the Interbeef project and genomic selection are viewed as two critical developments in the identification of the best genetics available worldwide for Irish farmers.},

abstract = {In Schweizer Schlachth{\"{o}}fen werden routinem{\"{a}}ssig die Fleischigkeit und die Fettgewebeklasse erhoben. In den letzten Jahren hat die durchschnittliche Fettgewebeklasse von Tieren der Markenprogramme Natura-Veal, Natura-Beef und SwissPrimBeef abgenommen. Natura- Veal sind Bankk{\"{a}}lber, die mit einem Alter von ungef{\"{a}}hr sechs Monaten direkt von der Mutter abgesetzt geschlachtet werden. Natura-Beef bezeichnet Fleisch von Jungtieren aus Mutterkuhhaltung, die als schlachtreife Absetzer mit ungef{\"{a}}hr zehn Monaten geschlachtet werden. SwissPrimBeef bezeichnet ebenfalls Fleisch aus Mutterkuhhaltung. Bis zum Absetzen wachsen die K{\"{a}}lber im Herdenverband bei der Mutter auf. Danach werden die Tiere bis zu einem Alter von ungef{\"{a}}hr 20 Monaten ausgem{\"{a}}stet. Die Entwicklung der abnehmenden Fettgewebeklasse ist nicht erwünscht. Zurzeit existiert in der Schweiz keine Zuchtwertsch{\"{a}}tzung für Fettgewebeklassen. Aus diesem Grund wurden in dieser Masterarbeit die Schlachtdaten der drei Markenprogramme von 2005 bis Mitte 2015 analysiert. In einem Modell A wurden die Fettgewebeklassen über alle Markenprogramme ausgewertet. Als fixe Effekte modelliert wurden Nettozunahme, Rasse, Geschlecht, Fleischigkeitsklasse, Markenprogramm, Markenprogramm*Alter und Markenprogramm*Alter2. Betrieb*Jahr wurde als zuf{\"{a}}lliger Effekt modelliert. In Modell B wurde jedes Markenprogramm separat ausgewertet. Modelliert wurden Nettozunahme, Rasse, Geschlecht, Fleischigkeitsklasse, Alter und Alter2 als fixe und Betrieb*Jahr als zuf{\"{a}}lliger Effekt. Dabei konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich der Effekt der Rasse auf die Fettgewebeklasse je nach Modell {\"{a}}ndert. Das heisst, es besteht eine Interaktion zwischen Markenprogramm und Rasse. W{\"{a}}hrend Angus in allen Markenprogrammen eine hohe Fettabdeckung erzielt, weisen Tiere der Rasse Grauvieh besonders im Natura-Veal eine gute Fettabdeckung auf. Als Natura-Beef weisen neben Hereford und Angus auch die Rassen Original Braunvieh, Limousin, Simmental und Aubrac gute Fettabdeckungen aus. Bei SwissPrimBeef sind es neben Hereford und Angus auch Tiere der Rasse Simmental und Salers, die eine gute Fettabdeckung aufweisen. In allen Modellen hatten weibliche Tiere eine h{\"{o}}here Fettabdeckung als m{\"{a}}nnliche kastrierte Tiere und diese hatten wiederum eine h{\"{o}}here Fettabdeckung als m{\"{a}}nnliche Tiere. Auch das Alter, das Alter2, die Nettozunahme und die Fleischigkeit haben einen signifikanten Effekt auf die Fettgewebeklasse. Die Auswertungen haben gezeigt, dass sowohl Modell A als auch Modell B akzeptable Resultate liefern. In Modell A sollte jedoch die Interaktion zwischen Markenprogramm und Rasse berücksichtigt werden. In einem n{\"{a}}chsten Schritt müssten die Modelle mit dem Tiereffekt erg{\"{a}}nzt werden, um die Verwandtschaft der Tiere zu berücksichtigen. Zus{\"{a}}tzlich sollte man genetische Gruppen für Rassen sch{\"{a}}tzen und nicht mit der Rasse mit dem h{\"{o}}chsten Blutanteil arbeiten. Eine Zuchtwertsch{\"{a}}tzung für die Fettgewebeklasse ist wichtig, um die Fleischqualit{\"{a}}t in Zukunft zu verbessern. Dabei sollte die Fettgewebeklasse und die Fleischigkeitsklasse in einem für den Landwirt anwendbarem Index vereint werden.},

The sub indices are designed to increase the profitability of different specific components of the beef industry. Secondly some initial results of a project that has begun, aiming to further optimize these developments, are presented. This project will focus on several issues including trait definition, modeling of breed effects in Irish data sets and determining appropriate fixed and random effects in a multibreed scenario. Initial heritabilities for carcase weight, carcase fat and carcase conformation as a function of age, using data gathered routinely in abattoirs, are presented. The data set was multibreed in nature. Fixed regressions on breed fractions were used to model breed effects. Carcase conformation for younger animals tended to have moderate to high heritabilities (0.32-0.50), while carcase fatness and carcase weight heritabilities for the same age range were slightly lower (0.23-0.39).},

The data comprised information on carcass weight (CWT), carcass fleshiness (FLESH) and carcass fatness grade (FAT) according to the (S)EUROP scale for 5870, 1509 and 1119 young bulls of the Charolais, Hereford and Simmental breeds, respectively. In addition, information on field-recorded pre-weaning gain (WG) and post-weaning gain (PWG) was available for more than 23 200 and 15 700 bulls, respectively. The breeds were analysed separately using BLUP animal models. The results showed that it is feasible to include field-recorded carcass traits in the genetic evaluation. The estimated direct heritabilities of FLESH, FAT, CWT, WG and PWG were in the ranges 0.21-0.39, 0.23-0.45, 0.42-0.70, 0.31-0.41 and 0.29-0.42, respectively. The genetic correlations differed between breeds, though for all breeds studied the genetic correlations with pre-weaning gain were weaker for FAT and FLESH than for CWT.

abstract = {Selection index theory was used to compare different selection strategies aiming at the improvement of meat quality in beef cattle. Alternative strategies were compared with a reference scenario with three basic traits in the selection index: BW at 200 d (W200) and 400 d (W400) and muscling score (MUSC). These traits resemble the combination currently used in the German national beef genetic evaluation system. Traits in the breeding goal were defi ned as the 3 basic traits plus marbling score (MARB), to depict a situation where an established breeding program currently selecting for growth and carcass yield intends to incorporate meat quality in its selection program. Economic weights were either the same for all 4 traits, or doubled or tripled for MARB. Two additional selection criteria for improving MARB were considered: Live animal intramuscular fat content measured by ultrasound (UIMF) as an indicator trait and a genomic breeding value (GEBV) for the target trait directly (gMARB). Results were used to estimate the required number of genotyped animals in an own calibration set for implementing genomic selection focusing on meat quality. Adding UIMF to the basic index increased the overall genetic gain per generation by 15{\%} when the economic weight on MARB was doubled and by 44{\%} when it was tripled. When a genomic breeding value for marbling could be estimated with an accuracy of 0.5, adding gMARB to the index provided larger genetic gain than adding UIMF. Greatest genetic gain per generation was obtained with the scenario containing GEBV for 4 traits (gW200, gW400, gMUSC, and gMARB) when the accuracies of these GEBV were ≥0.7. Adding UIMF to the index substantially improved response to selection for MARB, which switched from negative to positive when the economic weight on MARB was doubled or tripled. For all scenarios that contained gMARB in the selection index, the response to selection in MARB was positive for all relative economic weights on MARB, when the accuracy of GEBV was {\textgreater}0.7. Results indicated that setting up a calibration set of {\~{}}500 genotyped animals with carcass phenotypes for MARB could suffi ce to obtain a larger response to selection than measuring UIMF. If the size of the calibration set is {\~{}}2,500, adding the ultrasound trait to an index containing already the GEBV would bring little benefi t, unless the relative economic weight for marbling is much larger than for the other traits.},

abstract = {Livestock mature at different rates depending, in part, on their genetic merit; therefore, the optimal age at slaughter for progeny of certain sires may differ. The objective of the present study was to examine sire-level genetic profiles for car- cass weight, carcass conformation, and carcass fat in cattle of multiple beef and dairy breeds, including crossbreeds. Slaughter records from 126,214 heifers and 124,641 steers aged between 360 and 1,200 d and from 86,089 young bulls aged between 360 and 720 d were used in the analysis; animals were from 15,127 sires. Variance components for each trait across age at slaughter were generated using sire random regression models that included quadratic polynomials for fixed and random effects; hetero- geneous residual variances were assumed across ages. Heritability estimates across genders ranged from 0.08 (±0.02) to 0.34 (±0.02) for carcass weight, from 0.24 (±0.02) to 0.42 (±0.01) for conformation, and from 0.16 (±0.03) to 0.40 (±0.02) for fat score. Genetic correlations within each trait across ages weakened as the interval between ages compared lengthened but were all {\textgreater}0.64, suggesting a similar genetic background for each trait across different ages. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the additive genetic covariance matrix revealed genetic variabil- ity among animals in their growth profiles for carcass traits, although most of the genetic variability was associated with the height of the growth profile. At the same age, a positive genetic correlation (0.60 to 0.78; SE ranged from 0.01 to 0.04) existed between carcass weight and conformation, whereas negative genetic correlations existed between fatness and both conformation (–0.46 to 0.08; SE ranged from 0.02 to 0.09) and carcass weight (–0.48 to –0.16; SE ranged from 0.02 to 0.14) at the same age. The estimated genetic parameters in the present study indicate genetic variability in the growth trajectory in cattle, which can be exploited through breeding programs and used in decision support tools.},

abstract = {Abattoir data are an important source of information for the genetic evaluation of carcass traits, but also for on-farm management purposes. The present study aimed to quantify the contribution of herd environment to beef carcass characteristics (weight, conformation score and fat score) with particular emphasis on generating finishing herd-specific profiles for these traits across different ages at slaughter. Abattoir records from 46,115 heifers and 78,790 steers aged between 360 and 900 days, and from 22,971 young bulls aged between 360 and 720 days, were analysed. Finishing herd-year and animal genetic (co)variance components for each trait were estimated using random regression models. Across slaughter age and gender, the ratio of finishing herd-year to total phenotypic variance ranged from 0.31 to 0.72 for carcass weight, 0.21 to 0.57 for carcass conformation and 0.11 to 0.44 for carcass fat score. These parameters indicate that the finishing herd environment is an important contributor to carcass trait variability and amenable to improvement with management practices.},

abstract = {Economic benefits from the use of expected progeny of a sample of beef bulls with genetic evaluations were calculated over an integrated supply chain for combinations of price discounts for intramuscular fat and LM area. Fixed backfat finish and marketing at the point of optimized gross margins were considered. An economic model was used to calculate average expected gross margins for a sample of bulls. Across-breed, age-constant genetic evaluations were used to predict carcass characteristics of progeny including weight, retail yield, intramuscular fat, and LM area, as well as input requirements including feed and housing as a function of time on feed. Proportion of retail cuts affected by price discounts was included in the calculations. Optimizing endpoints did not affect rankings to any extent relative to a fixed end point in this sample of bulls, as a result of fixed endpoints being similar to optimized endpoints for the economic situation considered. However, rank correlations were only 0.63 and 0.71 between rankings for no discount being applied and rankings with discounts for intramuscular fat and LM area, for fixed and optimized endpoints, respectively. We conclude that market prices are necessary considerations in choices of bulls to use in commercial beef production.},

abstract = {BREEDOBJECT is a selection aid to help breed more profitable cattle. It targets the purpose the user defines. It can be used by stud and commercial beef producers, or potentially anyone in the production chain with an interest in selecting animals. Examples are given of uses by bull breeders, bull buyers, breed societies, semen companies and others. Opportunities for service providers are numerous, but payoffs depend on the capacity of users to capture sufficient of the benefits accruing from genetic improvement and the better identification of superior sires. INTRODUCTION Beef production is increasingly market driven. With this trend has come a greater need to balance different market traits and herd production traits when selecting seedstock. BREEDOBJECT (Barwick et al. 1992, 1994) is a selection tool for use with BREEDPLAN. It is a PC software package that helps with selection by drawing all the estimated breeding value (EBV) performance figures on a bull into a combined EBV for profit which describes how well the bull suits the user's purpose.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Profitability of beef production can be increased by genetically improving carcass traits. To construct breeding value evaluations for carcass traits, breed-specific genetic parameters were estimated for carcass weight, carcass conformation and carcass fat in five beef cattle breeds in Finland (Hereford, Aberdeen Angus, Simmental, Charolais and Limousin). Conformation and fat were visually scored using the EUROP carcass classification. Each breed was separately analyzed using a multitrait animal model. A total of 6879–19 539 animals per breed had phenotypes. For the five breeds, heritabilities were moderate for carcass weight ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.39 to 0.48, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04) and slightly lower for conformation ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.30 to 0.44, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04) and carcass fat ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.29 to 0.44, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04). The genetic correlation between carcass weight and conformation was favorable in all breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.37 to 0.53, s.e.=0.04 to 0.05), heavy carcasses being genetically more conformed. The phenotypic correlation between carcass weight and carcass fat was moderately positive in all breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.21 to 0.32), implying that increasing carcass weight was related to increasing fat levels. The respective genetic correlation was the strongest in Hereford ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.28, s.e.=0.05) and Angus ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.15, s.e.=0.05), the two small body-sized British breeds with the lowest conformation and the highest fat level. The correlation was weaker in the other breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.08 to 0.14). For Hereford, Angus and Simmental, more conformed carcasses were phenotypically fatter ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.11 to 0.15), but the respective genetic correlations were close to zero ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}−{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.05 to 0.04). In contrast, in the two large body-sized and muscular French breeds, the genetic correlation between conformation and fat was negative and the phenotypic correlation was close to zero or negative (Charolais: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}−{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.18, s.e.=0.06, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.02; Limousin: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}−{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.56, s.e.=0.04, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}−{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.13). The results indicate genetic variation for the genetic improvement of the carcass traits, favorable correlations for the simultaneous improvement of carcass weight and conformation in all breeds, and breed differences in the correlations of carcass fat. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
