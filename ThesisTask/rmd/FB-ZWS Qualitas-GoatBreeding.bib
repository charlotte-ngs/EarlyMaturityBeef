abstract = {Records from the milk recording scheme of Spanish Murciano-Granadina goats were studied to estimate genetic (co)variance components and breeding values throughout the first and second lactations. The data used consisted of 49,696 monthly test-day records of milk (MY), protein (PY), fat (FY), and dry matter (DMY) yields from 5,163 goats, distributed in 20 herds, offspring of 2,086 does and 206 bucks. These records were analyzed by 2-trait random regression models (RRM) and a repeatability test-day model (RTDM). At the middle of lactation, heritability estimates for MY, DMY, and FY obtained with RTDM were larger than those estimated with RRM, and the opposite was true for PY. The RRM estimates of heritability for MY, FY, and PY were very similar throughout the trajectories of both lactations. Heritability estimates for DMY decreased through the lactation period. The genetic correlations between the first and second lactation records estimated for all traits by RRM were positive and ranged from 0.43 to 0.80 throughout the lactation curves. The correlation between BV estimated with RTDM and RRM was 0.742 for MY and 0.664 for DMY. The RRM could be a useful alternative to RTDM for the prediction of BV in this breed.},

abstract = {Genetic evaluations of US dairy goats are calculated an-nually by USDA from records that are available through Dairy Herd Improvement programs and the American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA). The number of does in test plans used in genetic evaluations was 11,273 during 1999; participation in linear appraisal programs during 1999 was 3784 does, a decrease from the mean of 4285 does over the last 5 yr. For evaluation of yield traits, an animal model similar to that used for dairy cattle is used, but analysis is across breeds. Lactation records for the first six parities of does that were born since July 1973 and kidded since January 1976 are edited within limits appropriate for goats, projected to 305 d, and adjusted for kidding age and month. Evaluations are computed for milk, fat, and protein yields and component percentages; an economic index based on genetic merit for milk, fat, and pro-tein yields (MFP{\$}) is calculated, based on economic values for dairy cattle. A multitrait animal model is applied to 13 linear type traits and final score. A single-trait calculation method is accomplished by applying a canonical transforma-tion. Annual genetic progress for does born during 1996 as a percentage of mean breed yield was lowest for Toggenburgs (–0.1{\%}/yr, milk; 0.0{\%}/yr, fat and protein) and highest for Saanens (0.9{\%}/yr, milk and protein; 1.0{\%}/yr, fat). Annual genetic trend for type traits across breeds for does born during 1996 was 0.67 for stature; 0.37 for rump angle; 0.34 for teat placement; 0.22 for suspensory ligament; 0.20 for strength; 0.16 for teat diameter; 0.12 for rump width; 0.09 for rear legs; 0.06 for dairyness; 0.05 for final score; 0.01 for fore udder attachment and udder depth; –0.1 for udder depth; and –0.12 for rear udder height. Two production-type indexes are com-puted by ADGA with 2:1 and 1:2 weightings for yield (repre-sented by genetic merit for fat-corrected milk) and type (repre-sented by genetic merit for final score).},

abstract = {Covariance components for final score and 13 linear type traits of dairy goats were estimated by multitrait REML using canonical transformation with an animal model. Data were 10,932 type appraisals from 1988 through 1994 from herds with {\textgreater} or = 40 appraisals. Heritabilities were estimated as 0.27 for final score, 0.52 for stature, 0.29 for strength, 0.24 for dairyness, 0.38 for teat diameter, 0.21 for rear legs, 0.32 for rump angle, 0.27 rump width, 0.25 for fore udder attachment, 0.25 for rear udder height, 0.19 for rear udder arch, 0.25 for udder depth, 0.33 for suspensory ligament, and 0.36 for teat placement. Genetic correlations of linear type traits and final score were positive except for dairyness (-0.15) and teat diameter (-0.10); the largest correlations with final score were 0.66 for fore udder attachment, 0.44 for rear udder arch, 0.36 for rump width, and 0.30 for strength. The largest positive correlation among linear traits was 0.63 for stature and rump width; the largest negative correlation was -0.51 for strength and dairyness. Multitrait evaluations were calculated with data from all herds. Correlations between PTA calculated with animal and sire models ranged from 0.44 to 0.70 for bucks that had a PTA with a reliability of {\textgreater} or = 30{\%}.},

abstract = {First-parity 305-d milk yield and intervals between first and second kiddings from 1975 through 2005 were analyzed to estimate genetic and environmental parameters for United States Alpine, LaMancha, Nubian, Saanen, and Toggenburg dairy goats. The data set included 43,612 does with first-parity milk yield and 25,863 does with first kidding interval. Parameters were estimated by REML using bivariate mixed models within and across breeds. Fixed effects were month and herd-year of kidding within breed and month and breed-herd-year of kidding across breeds. Random effects were animal and residual. The heritability estimate for first-parity milk yield was 0.36+/-0.01 across breeds and ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 within breed; heritability for first kidding interval was 0.05+/-0.01 across breeds and ranged from 0.00 to 0.15 within breed. The estimate of the genetic correlation between first-parity milk yield and first kidding interval was positive (unfavorable) across breeds (0.35+/-0.09). Estimates of environmental correlations within and across breeds were positive (0.16-0.25). The presence of unfavorable genetic relationships between milk yield and kidding interval indicates a need to include reproductive performance as a selection criterion.},

abstract = {Test-day data for daily milk yield and fat, protein, and lactose content were sampled from the years 1988 to 2003 in 17 flocks belonging to 2 genetically well-tied buck circles. In total, records from 2,111 to 2,215 goats for content traits and 2,371 goats for daily milk yield were included in the analysis, averaging 2.6 and 4.8 observations per goat for the 2 groups of traits, respectively. The data were analyzed by using 4 test-day models with different modeling of fixed effects. Model [0] (the reference model) contained a fixed effect of year-season of kidding with regression on Ali-Schaeffer polynomials nested within the year-season classes, and a random effect of flock test-day. In model [1], the lactation curve effect from model [0] was replaced by a fixed effect of days in milk (in 3-d periods), the same for all year-seasons of kidding. Models [2] and [3] were obtained from model [1] by removing the fixed year-season of kidding effect and considering the flock test-day effect as either fixed or random, respectively. The models were compared by using 2 criteria: mean-squared error of prediction and a test of bias affecting the genetic trend. The first criterion indicated a preference for model [3], whereas the second criterion preferred model [1]. Mean-squared error of prediction is based on model fit, whereas the second criterion tests the ability of the model to produce unbiased genetic evaluation (i.e., its capability of separating environmental and genetic time trends). Thus, a fixed structure with year (year, year-season, or possibly flock-year) was indicated to appropriately separate time trends. Heritability estimates for daily milk yield and milk content were 0.26 and 0.24 to 0.27, respectively.},
