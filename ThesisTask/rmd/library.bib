@article{Berry2017a,
abstract = {Apprehension among consumers is mounting on the efficiency by which
cattle convert feedstuffs into human edible protein and energy as well
as the consequential effects on the environment. Most (genetic) studies
that attempt to address these issues have generally focused on
efficiency metrics defined over a certain time period of an animal's
life cycle, predominantly the period representing the linear phase of
growth. The age at which an animal reaches the carcass specifications
for slaughter, however, is also known to vary between breeds; less is
known on the extent of the within-breed variability in age at slaughter.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to quantify the
phenotypic and genetic variability in the age at which cattle reach a
predefined carcass weight and subcutaneous fat cover. A novel trait,
labeled here as the deviation in age at slaughter (DAGE), was
represented by the unexplained variability from a statistical model,
with age at slaughter as the dependent variable and with the fixed
effects, among others, of carcass weight and fat score (scale 1 to 15
scored by video image analysis of the carcass at slaughter). Variance
components for DAGE were estimated using either a 2-step approach (i.e.,
the DAGE phenotype derived first and then variance components estimated)
or a 1-step approach (i.e., variance components for age at slaughter
estimated directly in a mixed model that included the fixed effects of,
among others, carcass weight and carcass fat score as well as a random
direct additive genetic effect). The raw phenotypic SD in DAGE was 44.2
d. The genetic SD and heritability for DAGE estimated using the 1-step
or 2-step models varied from 14.2 to 15.1 d and from 0.23 to 0.26 (SE
0.02), respectively. Assuming the (genetic) variability in the number of
days from birth to reaching a desired carcass specifications can be
exploited without any associated unfavorable repercussions, considerable
potential exists to improve not only the (feed) efficiency of the animal
and farm system but also the environmental footprint of the system. The
beauty of the approach proposed, relative to strategies that select
directly for the feed intake complex and enteric methane emissions, is
that data on age at slaughter are generally readily available. Of
course, faster gains may potentially be achieved if a dual objective of
improving animal efficiency per day coupled with reduced days to
slaughter was embarked on.},

abstract = {The first aim of this study is to review the recent development of economic selection indices for beef cattle in Ireland, consisting of a beef production sub index (BPSI), beef and dairy calving sub indices (BPSI, DCSI), a maternal sub index (MSI), a weaned calf sub index (WCSI) and consequential total beef merit indices. The sub indices are designed to increase the profitability of different specific components of the beef industry. Secondly some initial results of a project that has begun, aiming to further optimize these developments, are presented. This project will focus on several issues including trait definition, modeling of breed effects in Irish data sets and determining appropriate fixed and random effects in a multibreed scenario. Initial heritabilities for carcase weight, carcase fat and carcase conformation as a function of age, using data gathered routinely in abattoirs, are presented. The data set was multibreed in nature. Fixed regressions on breed fractions were used to model breed effects. Carcase conformation for younger animals tended to have moderate to high heritabilities (0.32-0.50), while carcase fatness and carcase weight heritabilities for the same age range were slightly lower (0.23-0.39).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Profitability of beef production can be increased by genetically improving carcass traits. To construct breeding value evaluations for carcass traits, breed-specific genetic parameters were estimated for carcass weight, carcass conformation and carcass fat in five beef cattle breeds in Finland (Hereford, Aberdeen Angus, Simmental, Charolais and Limousin). Conformation and fat were visually scored using the EUROP carcass classification. Each breed was separately analyzed using a multitrait animal model. A total of 6879â€“19 539 animals per breed had phenotypes. For the five breeds, heritabilities were moderate for carcass weight ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.39 to 0.48, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04) and slightly lower for conformation ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.30 to 0.44, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04) and carcass fat ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.29 to 0.44, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04). The genetic correlation between carcass weight and conformation was favorable in all breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.37 to 0.53, s.e.=0.04 to 0.05), heavy carcasses being genetically more conformed. The phenotypic correlation between carcass weight and carcass fat was moderately positive in all breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.21 to 0.32), implying that increasing carcass weight was related to increasing fat levels. The respective genetic correlation was the strongest in Hereford ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.28, s.e.=0.05) and Angus ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.15, s.e.=0.05), the two small body-sized British breeds with the lowest conformation and the highest fat level. The correlation was weaker in the other breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.08 to 0.14). For Hereford, Angus and Simmental, more conformed carcasses were phenotypically fatter ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.11 to 0.15), but the respective genetic correlations were close to zero ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}âˆ’{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.05 to 0.04). In contrast, in the two large body-sized and muscular French breeds, the genetic correlation between conformation and fat was negative and the phenotypic correlation was close to zero or negative (Charolais: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}âˆ’{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.18, s.e.=0.06, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.02; Limousin: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}âˆ’{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.56, s.e.=0.04, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}âˆ’{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.13). The results indicate genetic variation for the genetic improvement of the carcass traits, favorable correlations for the simultaneous improvement of carcass weight and conformation in all breeds, and breed differences in the correlations of carcass fat. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. The objective of this study was to investigate the application of BLUP and single step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) models in different scenarios of paternity uncertainty with different strategies of scaling the G matrix to match the A22 matrix, using simulated data for beef cattle. Genotypes, pedigree, and phenotypes for age at first calving (AFC) and weight at 550 days (W550) were simulated using heritabilities based on real data (0.12 for AFC and 0.34 for W550). Paternity uncertainty scenarios using 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100{\%} of multiple sires (MS) were studied. The simulated genome had a total length of 2,333 cM, containing 735,293 biallelic markers and 7,000 QTLs randomly distributed over the 29 BTA. It was assumed that QTLs explained 100{\%} of the genetic variance. For QTL, the amount of alleles per loci randomly ranged from two to four. The BLUP model that considers phenotypic and pedigree data, and the ssGBLUP model that combines phenotypic, pedigree and genomic information were used for genetic evaluations. Four ways of scaling the mean of the genomic matrix (G) to match to the mean of the pedigree relationship matrix among genotyped animals (A 22 ) were tested. Accuracy, bias, and inflation were investigated for five groups of animals: ALL = all animals; BULL = only bulls; GEN = genotyped animals; FEM = females; and YOUNG = young males. With the BLUP model, the accuracies of genetic evaluations decreased for both traits as the proportion of unknown sires in the population increased. The EBV accuracy reduction was higher for GEN and YOUNG groups. By analyzing the scenarios for YOUNG (from 0 to 100{\%} of MS), the decrease was 87.8 and 86{\%} for AFC and W550, respectively. When applying the ssGBLUP model, the accuracies of genetic evaluation also decreased as the MS in the pedigree for both traits increased. However, the accuracy reduction was less than those observed for BLUP model. Using the same comparison (scenario 0 to 100{\%} of MS), the accuracies reductions were 38 and 44.6{\%} for AFC and W550, respectively. There were no differences between the strategies for scaling the G matrix for ALL, BULL, and FEM groups under the different scenarios with missing pedigree. These results pointed out that the uninformative part of the A 22  matrix and genotyped animals with paternity uncertainty did not influence the scaling of G matrix. On the basis of the results, it is important to have a G matrix in the same scale of the A 22  matrix, especially for the evaluation of young animals in situations with missing pedigree information. In these situations, the ssGBLUP model is an appropriate alternative to obtain a more reliable and less biased estimate of breeding values, especially for young animals with few or no phenotypic records. For accurate and unbiased genomic predictions with ssGBLUP, it is necessary to assure that the G matrix is compatible with the A 22  matrix, even in situations with paternity uncertainty.},

Abattoir records from 46,115 heifers and 78,790 steers aged between 360 and 900Â days, and from 22,971 young bulls aged between 360 and 720Â days, were analysed. Finishing herd-year and animal genetic (co)variance components for each trait were estimated using random regression models. Across slaughter age and gender, the ratio of finishing herd-year to total phenotypic variance ranged from 0.31 to 0.72 for carcass weight, 0.21 to 0.57 for carcass conformation and 0.11 to 0.44 for carcass fat score. These parameters indicate that the finishing herd environment is an important contributor to carcass trait variability and amenable to improvement with management practices.},

It can be used by stud and commercial beef producers, or potentially anyone in the production chain with an interest in selecting animals. Examples are given of uses by bull breeders, bull buyers, breed societies, semen companies and others. Opportunities for service providers are numerous, but payoffs depend on the capacity of users to capture sufficient of the benefits accruing from genetic improvement and the better identification of superior sires. INTRODUCTION Beef production is increasingly market driven. With this trend has come a greater need to balance different market traits and herd production traits when selecting seedstock. BREEDOBJECT (Barwick et al. 1992, 1994) is a selection tool for use with BREEDPLAN. It is a PC software package that helps with selection by drawing all the estimated breeding value (EBV) performance figures on a bull into a combined EBV for profit which describes how well the bull suits the user's purpose.},

abstract = {Selection index theory was used to compare different selection strategies aiming at the improvement of meat quality in beef cattle. Alternative strategies were compared with a reference scenario with three basic traits in the selection index: BW at 200 d (W200) and 400 d (W400) and muscling score (MUSC). These traits resemble the combination currently used in the German national beef genetic evaluation system. Traits in the breeding goal were defi ned as the 3 basic traits plus marbling score (MARB), to depict a situation where an established breeding program currently selecting for growth and carcass yield intends to incorporate meat quality in its selection program. Economic weights were either the same for all 4 traits, or doubled or tripled for MARB. Two additional selection criteria for improving MARB were considered: Live animal intramuscular fat content measured by ultrasound (UIMF) as an indicator trait and a genomic breeding value (GEBV) for the target trait directly (gMARB). Results were used to estimate the required number of genotyped animals in an own calibration set for implementing genomic selection focusing on meat quality. Adding UIMF to the basic index increased the overall genetic gain per generation by 15{\%} when the economic weight on MARB was doubled and by 44{\%} when it was tripled. When a genomic breeding value for marbling could be estimated with an accuracy of 0.5, adding gMARB to the index provided larger genetic gain than adding UIMF. Greatest genetic gain per generation was obtained with the scenario containing GEBV for 4 traits (gW200, gW400, gMUSC, and gMARB) when the accuracies of these GEBV were â‰¥0.7. Adding UIMF to the index substantially improved response to selection for MARB, which switched from negative to positive when the economic weight on MARB was doubled or tripled. For all scenarios that contained gMARB in the selection index, the response to selection in MARB was positive for all relative economic weights on MARB, when the accuracy of GEBV was {\textgreater}0.7. Results indicated that setting up a calibration set of {\~{}}500 genotyped animals with carcass phenotypes for MARB could suffi ce to obtain a larger response to selection than measuring UIMF. If the size of the calibration set is {\~{}}2,500, adding the ultrasound trait to an index containing already the GEBV would bring little benefi t, unless the relative economic weight for marbling is much larger than for the other traits.},

abstract = {In Schweizer Schlachth{\"{o}}fen werden routinem{\"{a}}ssig die Fleischigkeit und die Fettgewebeklasse erhoben. In den letzten Jahren hat die durchschnittliche Fettgewebeklasse von Tieren der Markenprogramme Natura-Veal, Natura-Beef und SwissPrimBeef abgenommen. Natura- Veal sind Bankk{\"{a}}lber, die mit einem Alter von ungef{\"{a}}hr sechs Monaten direkt von der Mutter abgesetzt geschlachtet werden. Natura-Beef bezeichnet Fleisch von Jungtieren aus Mutterkuhhaltung, die als schlachtreife Absetzer mit ungef{\"{a}}hr zehn Monaten geschlachtet werden. SwissPrimBeef bezeichnet ebenfalls Fleisch aus Mutterkuhhaltung. Bis zum Absetzen wachsen die K{\"{a}}lber im Herdenverband bei der Mutter auf. Danach werden die Tiere bis zu einem Alter von ungef{\"{a}}hr 20 Monaten ausgem{\"{a}}stet. Die Entwicklung der abnehmenden Fettgewebeklasse ist nicht erwuÌˆnscht. Zurzeit existiert in der Schweiz keine Zuchtwertsch{\"{a}}tzung fuÌˆr Fettgewebeklassen. Aus diesem Grund wurden in dieser Masterarbeit die Schlachtdaten der drei Markenprogramme von 2005 bis Mitte 2015 analysiert. In einem Modell A wurden die Fettgewebeklassen uÌˆber alle Markenprogramme ausgewertet. Als fixe Effekte modelliert wurden Nettozunahme, Rasse, Geschlecht, Fleischigkeitsklasse, Markenprogramm, Markenprogramm*Alter und Markenprogramm*Alter2. Betrieb*Jahr wurde als zuf{\"{a}}lliger Effekt modelliert. In Modell B wurde jedes Markenprogramm separat ausgewertet. Modelliert wurden Nettozunahme, Rasse, Geschlecht, Fleischigkeitsklasse, Alter und Alter2 als fixe und Betrieb*Jahr als zuf{\"{a}}lliger Effekt. Dabei konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich der Effekt der Rasse auf die Fettgewebeklasse je nach Modell {\"{a}}ndert. Das heisst, es besteht eine Interaktion zwischen Markenprogramm und Rasse. W{\"{a}}hrend Angus in allen Markenprogrammen eine hohe Fettabdeckung erzielt, weisen Tiere der Rasse Grauvieh besonders im Natura-Veal eine gute Fettabdeckung auf. Als Natura-Beef weisen neben Hereford und Angus auch die Rassen Original Braunvieh, Limousin, Simmental und Aubrac gute Fettabdeckungen aus. Bei SwissPrimBeef sind es neben Hereford und Angus auch Tiere der Rasse Simmental und Salers, die eine gute Fettabdeckung aufweisen. In allen Modellen hatten weibliche Tiere eine h{\"{o}}here Fettabdeckung als m{\"{a}}nnliche kastrierte Tiere und diese hatten wiederum eine h{\"{o}}here Fettabdeckung als m{\"{a}}nnliche Tiere. Auch das Alter, das Alter2, die Nettozunahme und die Fleischigkeit haben einen signifikanten Effekt auf die Fettgewebeklasse. Die Auswertungen haben gezeigt, dass sowohl Modell A als auch Modell B akzeptable Resultate liefern. In Modell A sollte jedoch die Interaktion zwischen Markenprogramm und Rasse beruÌˆcksichtigt werden. In einem n{\"{a}}chsten Schritt muÌˆssten die Modelle mit dem Tiereffekt erg{\"{a}}nzt werden, um die Verwandtschaft der Tiere zu beruÌˆcksichtigen. Zus{\"{a}}tzlich sollte man genetische Gruppen fuÌˆr Rassen sch{\"{a}}tzen und nicht mit der Rasse mit dem h{\"{o}}chsten Blutanteil arbeiten. Eine Zuchtwertsch{\"{a}}tzung fuÌˆr die Fettgewebeklasse ist wichtig, um die Fleischqualit{\"{a}}t in Zukunft zu verbessern. Dabei sollte die Fettgewebeklasse und die Fleischigkeitsklasse in einem fuÌˆr den Landwirt anwendbarem Index vereint werden.},

abstract = {Records from the milk recording scheme of Spanish Murciano-Granadina goats were studied to estimate genetic (co)variance components and breeding values throughout the first and second lactations. The data used consisted of 49,696 monthly test-day records of milk (MY), protein (PY), fat (FY), and dry matter (DMY) yields from 5,163 goats, distributed in 20 herds, offspring of 2,086 does and 206 bucks. These records were analyzed by 2-trait random regression models (RRM) and a repeatability test-day model (RTDM). At the middle of lactation, heritability estimates for MY, DMY, and FY obtained with RTDM were larger than those estimated with RRM, and the opposite was true for PY. The RRM estimates of heritability for MY, FY, and PY were very similar throughout the trajectories of both lactations. Heritability estimates for DMY decreased through the lactation period. The genetic correlations between the first and second lactation records estimated for all traits by RRM were positive and ranged from 0.43 to 0.80 throughout the lactation curves. The correlation between BV estimated with RTDM and RRM was 0.742 for MY and 0.664 for DMY. The RRM could be a useful alternative to RTDM for the prediction of BV in this breed.},

abstract = {Milk yield has a strong effect on fertility, but it may vary across different herds and individual cows. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of breed and its interaction with level of milk production at the herd level (Herd-L) and at a cow-within-herd level (Cow-L) on fertility traits in dairy cattle. Data were gathered from Holstein (n = 17,688), Brown Swiss (n = 32,697), Simmental (n = 27,791), and Alpine Grey (n = 13,689) cows in northeastern Italy. The analysis was based on records from the first 3 lactations in the years 2011 to 2014. A mixed model was fitted to establish milk production levels of the various herds (Herd-L) and individual cows (Cow-L) using milk as a response variable. The interval fertility traits were interval from calving to first service, interval from first service to conception, and number of days open. The success traits were nonreturn rate at 56 d after first service, pregnancy rate at first service, and the number of inseminations. The interval from calving to first service, interval from first service to conception, and number of days open were analyzed using a Cox's proportional hazards model. The nonreturn rate at 56 d after first service, pregnancy rate at first service, and the number of inseminations were analyzed using logistic regression. There was a strong interaction between breed and productivity class at both Herd-L and Cow-L on all traits. The effects of herd and cow productivity differed from each other and differed among breeds. The dual-purpose Simmental and Alpine Grey breeds had better fertility than the specialized Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows; this difference is only partly attributable to different milk yields. Greater herd productivity can result in higher fertility in cows, whereas higher milk yield of individual cows within a herd results in lower fertility. These effects at both Herd-L and Cow-L are curvilinear and are stronger in dual-purpose breeds, which was more evident from low to intermediate milk yield levels than from central to high productivity classes. Disentangling the effects of milk productivity on fertility at Herd-L and Cow-L and taking the nonlinearity of response into account could lead to better modeling of populations within breed. It could also help with managementâ€”for example, in precision dairy farming of dairy and dual-purpose cattle. Moreover, assessing the fertility of various breeds and their different responses to herd and individual productivity levels could be useful in devising more profitable crossbreeding programs in different dairy systems.},

The data set included 43,612 does with first-parity milk yield and 25,863 does with first kidding interval. Parameters were estimated by REML using bivariate mixed models within and across breeds. Fixed effects were month and herd-year of kidding within breed and month and breed-herd-year of kidding across breeds. Random effects were animal and residual. The heritability estimate for first-parity milk yield was 0.36+/-0.01 across breeds and ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 within breed; heritability for first kidding interval was 0.05+/-0.01 across breeds and ranged from 0.00 to 0.15 within breed. The estimate of the genetic correlation between first-parity milk yield and first kidding interval was positive (unfavorable) across breeds (0.35+/-0.09). Estimates of environmental correlations within and across breeds were positive (0.16-0.25). The presence of unfavorable genetic relationships between milk yield and kidding interval indicates a need to include reproductive performance as a selection criterion.},

The commercial suckler herd is predominantly crossbred with a minority pedigree population (3.5{\%}). Beef performance evaluations in the Republic of Ireland have focused on improvement in carcass traits as the breeding goal due to the volumes of data available for this trait from the commercial beef and dairy herds. In addition pedigree herds rely heavily on imported genetics and therefore cooperation with foreign evaluation centers is well established for the sharing and incorporation of foreign breeding values. In the future, participation in the Interbeef project and genomic selection are viewed as two critical developments in the identification of the best genetics available worldwide for Irish farmers.},

@article{Berry2017,
abstract = {Apprehension among consumers is mounting on the efficiency by which
cattle convert feedstuffs into human edible protein and energy as well
as the consequential effects on the environment. Most (genetic) studies
that attempt to address these issues have generally focused on
efficiency metrics defined over a certain time period of an animal's
life cycle, predominantly the period representing the linear phase of
growth. The age at which an animal reaches the carcass specifications
for slaughter, however, is also known to vary between breeds; less is
known on the extent of the within-breed variability in age at slaughter.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to quantify the
phenotypic and genetic variability in the age at which cattle reach a
predefined carcass weight and subcutaneous fat cover. A novel trait,
labeled here as the deviation in age at slaughter (DAGE), was
represented by the unexplained variability from a statistical model,
with age at slaughter as the dependent variable and with the fixed
effects, among others, of carcass weight and fat score (scale 1 to 15
scored by video image analysis of the carcass at slaughter). Variance
components for DAGE were estimated using either a 2-step approach (i.e.,
the DAGE phenotype derived first and then variance components estimated)
or a 1-step approach (i.e., variance components for age at slaughter
estimated directly in a mixed model that included the fixed effects of,
among others, carcass weight and carcass fat score as well as a random
direct additive genetic effect). The raw phenotypic SD in DAGE was 44.2
d. The genetic SD and heritability for DAGE estimated using the 1-step
or 2-step models varied from 14.2 to 15.1 d and from 0.23 to 0.26 (SE
0.02), respectively. Assuming the (genetic) variability in the number of
days from birth to reaching a desired carcass specifications can be
exploited without any associated unfavorable repercussions, considerable
potential exists to improve not only the (feed) efficiency of the animal
and farm system but also the environmental footprint of the system. The
beauty of the approach proposed, relative to strategies that select
directly for the feed intake complex and enteric methane emissions, is
that data on age at slaughter are generally readily available. Of
course, faster gains may potentially be achieved if a dual objective of
improving animal efficiency per day coupled with reduced days to
slaughter was embarked on.},

abstract = {Test-day data for daily milk yield and fat, protein, and lactose content were sampled from the years 1988 to 2003 in 17 flocks belonging to 2 genetically well-tied buck circles. In total, records from 2,111 to 2,215 goats for content traits and 2,371 goats for daily milk yield were included in the analysis, averaging 2.6 and 4.8 observations per goat for the 2 groups of traits, respectively. The data were analyzed by using 4 test-day models with different modeling of fixed effects. Model [0] (the reference model) contained a fixed effect of year-season of kidding with regression on Ali-Schaeffer polynomials nested within the year-season classes, and a random effect of flock test-day. In model [1], the lactation curve effect from model [0] was replaced by a fixed effect of days in milk (in 3-d periods), the same for all year-seasons of kidding. Models [2] and [3] were obtained from model [1] by removing the fixed year-season of kidding effect and considering the flock test-day effect as either fixed or random, respectively. The models were compared by using 2 criteria: mean-squared error of prediction and a test of bias affecting the genetic trend. The first criterion indicated a preference for model [3], whereas the second criterion preferred model [1]. Mean-squared error of prediction is based on model fit, whereas the second criterion tests the ability of the model to produce unbiased genetic evaluation (i.e., its capability of separating environmental and genetic time trends). Thus, a fixed structure with year (year, year-season, or possibly flock-year) was indicated to appropriately separate time trends. Heritability estimates for daily milk yield and milk content were 0.26 and 0.24 to 0.27, respectively.},

abstract = {Current genetic evaluations are performed separately for each breed. Multiple breed genetic evaluations, however, assume a common base among breeds, enabling producers to compare cattle of different breed makeup. Breed and heterosis effects are needed in a multibreed evaluation because databases maintained by breed associations include few crossbred animals, which may not be enough to accurately estimate these effects. The objective of this study was to infer breed effects, maternal effects, direct heterosis effects, and maternal heterosis effects for growth and carcass traits using least squares means estimates from crossbreeding studies published in the literature from 1976 to 1996. The data set was formed by recording each least squares mean along with the breed composition, maternal breed composition, and direct and maternal heterozygosity. Each trait was analyzed using a single trait fixed effect model, which included study as a fixed effect and breed composition and heterozygosity as covariates. Breed solutions for each trait were expressed relative to the Angus breed. Direct breed effects for weaning weight ranged from -7.0 +/- 0.67 kg (British Dairy) to 29.3 +/- 0.74 kg (Simmental), and maternal effects ranged from -11.7 +/- 0.24 kg (Hereford) to 31.1 +/- 2.22 kg (Gelbvieh). Direct breed effects for birth weight ranged from -0.5 +/- 0.14 kg (British Dairy) to 10.1 +/- 0.46 kg (Continental Beef), and maternal effects ranged from -7.2 +/- 0.13 kg (Brahman) to 6.0 +/- 1.07 kg (Continental Beef). Direct breed effects ranged from -17.9 +/- 1.64 kg (Brahman) to 21.6 +/- 1.95 kg (Charolais), from -6.5 +/- 1.29 kg (Brahman) to 55.8 +/- 1.47 kg (Continental Beef), from -8.1 +/- 0.48 cm(2) (Shorthorn) to 21.0 +/- 0.48 cm(2) (Continental Beef), and from -1.1 +/- 0.02 cm (Continental Beef) to 0 +/- 0.00 cm (Angus) for postweaning BW gain, carcass weight, LM area, and fat thickness, respectively. The use of literature estimates to predict direct and maternal breed and heterosis effects may supplement their direct prediction in a multibreed evaluation.},

abstract = {Livestock mature at different rates depending, in part, on their genetic merit; therefore, the optimal age at slaughter for progeny of certain sires may differ. The objective of the present study was to examine sire-level genetic profiles for car- cass weight, carcass conformation, and carcass fat in cattle of multiple beef and dairy breeds, including crossbreeds. Slaughter records from 126,214 heifers and 124,641 steers aged between 360 and 1,200 d and from 86,089 young bulls aged between 360 and 720 d were used in the analysis; animals were from 15,127 sires. Variance components for each trait across age at slaughter were generated using sire random regression models that included quadratic polynomials for fixed and random effects; hetero- geneous residual variances were assumed across ages. Heritability estimates across genders ranged from 0.08 (Â±0.02) to 0.34 (Â±0.02) for carcass weight, from 0.24 (Â±0.02) to 0.42 (Â±0.01) for conformation, and from 0.16 (Â±0.03) to 0.40 (Â±0.02) for fat score. Genetic correlations within each trait across ages weakened as the interval between ages compared lengthened but were all {\textgreater}0.64, suggesting a similar genetic background for each trait across different ages. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the additive genetic covariance matrix revealed genetic variabil- ity among animals in their growth profiles for carcass traits, although most of the genetic variability was associated with the height of the growth profile. At the same age, a positive genetic correlation (0.60 to 0.78; SE ranged from 0.01 to 0.04) existed between carcass weight and conformation, whereas negative genetic correlations existed between fatness and both conformation (â€“0.46 to 0.08; SE ranged from 0.02 to 0.09) and carcass weight (â€“0.48 to â€“0.16; SE ranged from 0.02 to 0.14) at the same age. The estimated genetic parameters in the present study indicate genetic variability in the growth trajectory in cattle, which can be exploited through breeding programs and used in decision support tools.},

abstract = {Genetic evaluations of US dairy goats are calculated an-nually by USDA from records that are available through Dairy Herd Improvement programs and the American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA). The number of does in test plans used in genetic evaluations was 11,273 during 1999; participation in linear appraisal programs during 1999 was 3784 does, a decrease from the mean of 4285 does over the last 5 yr. For evaluation of yield traits, an animal model similar to that used for dairy cattle is used, but analysis is across breeds. Lactation records for the first six parities of does that were born since July 1973 and kidded since January 1976 are edited within limits appropriate for goats, projected to 305 d, and adjusted for kidding age and month. Evaluations are computed for milk, fat, and protein yields and component percentages; an economic index based on genetic merit for milk, fat, and pro-tein yields (MFP{\$}) is calculated, based on economic values for dairy cattle. A multitrait animal model is applied to 13 linear type traits and final score. A single-trait calculation method is accomplished by applying a canonical transforma-tion. Annual genetic progress for does born during 1996 as a percentage of mean breed yield was lowest for Toggenburgs (â€“0.1{\%}/yr, milk; 0.0{\%}/yr, fat and protein) and highest for Saanens (0.9{\%}/yr, milk and protein; 1.0{\%}/yr, fat). Annual genetic trend for type traits across breeds for does born during 1996 was 0.67 for stature; 0.37 for rump angle; 0.34 for teat placement; 0.22 for suspensory ligament; 0.20 for strength; 0.16 for teat diameter; 0.12 for rump width; 0.09 for rear legs; 0.06 for dairyness; 0.05 for final score; 0.01 for fore udder attachment and udder depth; â€“0.1 for udder depth; and â€“0.12 for rear udder height. Two production-type indexes are com-puted by ADGA with 2:1 and 1:2 weightings for yield (repre-sented by genetic merit for fat-corrected milk) and type (repre-sented by genetic merit for final score).},

Fixed backfat finish and marketing at the point of optimized gross margins were considered. An economic model was used to calculate average expected gross margins for a sample of bulls. Across-breed, age-constant genetic evaluations were used to predict carcass characteristics of progeny including weight, retail yield, intramuscular fat, and LM area, as well as input requirements including feed and housing as a function of time on feed. Proportion of retail cuts affected by price discounts was included in the calculations. Optimizing endpoints did not affect rankings to any extent relative to a fixed end point in this sample of bulls, as a result of fixed endpoints being similar to optimized endpoints for the economic situation considered. However, rank correlations were only 0.63 and 0.71 between rankings for no discount being applied and rankings with discounts for intramuscular fat and LM area, for fixed and optimized endpoints, respectively. We conclude that market prices are necessary considerations in choices of bulls to use in commercial beef production.},

In the cowâ€“calf population (suckler cow population) of the same breed, the economic values of feed efficiency traits along with 15 further production and functional traits were calculated. The marginal economic values of clinical mastitis and claw disease incidence in the dairy system were âˆ’â‚¬70.65 and âˆ’â‚¬26.73 per case per cow and year, respectively. The marginal economic values for residual feed intake were âˆ’â‚¬55.15 and âˆ’â‚¬54.64/kg of dry matter per day for cows and breeding heifers in the dairy system and âˆ’â‚¬20.45, âˆ’â‚¬11.30, and âˆ’â‚¬6.04/kg of dry matter per day for cows, breeding heifers, and fattened animals in the cowâ€“calf system, respectively, all expressed per cow and year. The sums of the relative economic values for the 2 new health traits in the dairy system and for residual feed intake across all cattle categories in both systems were 1.4 and 8{\%}, respectively. Within the dairy production system, the highest relative economic values were for milk yield (20{\%}), daily gain of calves (20{\%}), productive lifetime (10{\%}), and cow conception rate (8{\%}). In the cowâ€“calf system, the most important traits were weight gain of calves from 120 to 210d and from birth to 120d (19 and 14{\%}, respectively), productive lifetime (17{\%}), and cow conception rate (13{\%}). Based on the calculation of economic values for traits in the dual-purpose Pinzgau breed, milk production and growth traits remain highly important in the breeding goal, but their relative importance should be adapted to new production and economic conditions. The economic importance of functional traits (especially of cow productive lifetime and fertility) was sufficiently high to make the inclusion of these traits into the breeding goal necessary. An increased interest of consumers in animal welfare and quality of dairy farm products should probably lead to the incorporation of health traits (clinical mastitis incidence and somatic cells score) into the breeding goal. However, keeping carcass traits in the breeding goal of the Slovak Pinzgau breed does not seem to be relevant to the long-term market situation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {To investigate the possibility of using carcass data from commercial slaughterhouses for the genetic evaluation of beef cattle, genetic parameters for carcass traits and their correlations with field-recorded growth traits were estimated. The data comprised information on carcass weight (CWT), carcass fleshiness (FLESH) and carcass fatness grade (FAT) according to the (S)EUROP scale for 5870, 1509 and 1119 young bulls of the Charolais, Hereford and Simmental breeds, respectively. In addition, information on field-recorded pre-weaning gain (WG) and post-weaning gain (PWG) was available for more than 23 200 and 15 700 bulls, respectively. The breeds were analysed separately using BLUP animal models. The results showed that it is feasible to include field-recorded carcass traits in the genetic evaluation. The estimated direct heritabilities of FLESH, FAT, CWT, WG and PWG were in the ranges 0.21-0.39, 0.23-0.45, 0.42-0.70, 0.31-0.41 and 0.29-0.42, respectively. The genetic correlations differed between breeds, though for all breeds studied the genetic correlations with pre-weaning gain were weaker for FAT and FLESH than for CWT. The effect of selection on pre-weaning gain appeared to be stronger for CWT than for the other traits. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify if genomic variations associated with fatty acid (FA) composition are similar between the Holstein-Friesian (HF) and native dual-purpose breeds used in the Dutch dairy industry. Phenotypic and genotypic information were available for the breeds Meuse-Rhine-Yssel (MRY), Dutch Friesian (DF), Groningen White Headed (GWH), and HF. First, the reliability of genomic breeding values of the native Dutch dual-purpose cattle breeds MRY, DF, and GWH was evaluated using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects estimated in HF, including all SNP or subsets with stronger associations in HF. Second, the genomic variation of the regions associated with FA composition in HF (regions on Bos taurus autosome 5, 14, and 26), were studied in the different breeds. Finally, similarities in genotype and allele frequencies between MRY, DF, GWH, and HF breeds were assessed for specific regions associated with FA composition. On average across the traits, the highest reliabilities of genomic prediction were estimated for GWH (0.158) and DF (0.116) when the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were included. With the same set of SNP, GEBV for MRY were the least reliable (0.022). This indicates that on average only 2 (MRY) to 16{\%} (GWH) of the genomic variation in HF is shared with the native Dutch dual-purpose breeds. The comparison of predicted variances of different regions associated with milk and milk fat composition showed that breeds clearly differed in genomic variation within these regions. Finally, the correlations of allele frequencies between breeds across the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were around 0.8 between the Dutch native dual-purpose breeds, whereas the correlations between the native breeds and HF were clearly lower and around 0.5. There was no consistent relationship between the reliabilities of genomic prediction for a specific breed and the correlation between the allele frequencies of this breed and HF. In conclusion, most of the genomic variation associated with FA composition in the Dutch dual-purpose breeds appears to be breed-specific. Furthermore, the minor allele frequencies of genes having an effect on the milk FA composition in HF were shown to be much smaller in the breeds MRY, DF, and GWH, especially for the MRY breed.},
