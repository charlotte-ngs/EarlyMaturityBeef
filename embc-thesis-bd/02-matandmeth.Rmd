# Material and Methods {#matandmeth}
Based on the earlier made observation in chapter \@ref(intro), it is important to improve __early maturity__ in Swiss beef cattle. One possibility for improving a certain trait is to use this trait in a breeding program. An important prerequisite for the use of a certain trait in a breeding program is that we can precisely define the trait and that the trait can easily and efficiently be measured.

## Definition of Early Maturity {#defem}
In the context of this project, animals are earlier mature if they reach the state of carcass maturity faster than others. Carcass maturity is given by the minimal requirements of the pricing system given by Proviande ().
