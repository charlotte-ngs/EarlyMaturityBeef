## Background

Up until summer 2018, the Swiss beef cattle breeders association has been focusing their genetic evaluations mainly on growth rate and carcass conformation. 
Lately it has been observed that carcass fat is decreasing at least for some beef cattle breeds, see \@ref(fig:genetictrendCF). The decrease of carcass fat leads to a price reduction of the carcass [@Hospenthal2016].

```{r genetictrendCF, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Genetic trend of carcass fat 1995-2015", out.width="100%", out.height="50%",fig.align='center', fig.pos='H'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/intro/genetictrend.pdf", auto_pdf = T)
```

Several stakeholders derive from the decreasing levels of carcass fat that Swiss beef cattle does not show any improvements in the trait early maturity. 


One possibility to improve early maturity is to use early maturity in a breeding program. 
Early maturity must be preciseley defined and efficiently measurable to include it in a breeding program.

## Definition of Early Maturity {#defem}
This thesis builds on the following definition: Animals mature early if they reach the state of carcass maturity faster than others but get the same price at the slaughterhouse.

Four strategies sorted by increasing complexity:

1. Carcass fat as auxilliary trait

2. Index over carcass traits

3. "Deviation in age at slaughter" from @Berry2017

4. Growth models
