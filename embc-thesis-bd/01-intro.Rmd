# Introduction {#intro}

## Background

Up until summer 2018, the Swiss beef cattle breeders association has been focusing their genetic evaluations mainly on growth rate and carcass conformation. 
Lately it has been observed that carcass fat is decreasing at least for some beef cattle breeds, see \@ref(fig:genetictrendCF). The decrease of carcass fat leads to a price reduction of the carcass [@Hospenthal2016].

```{r genetictrendCF, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Genetic trend of carcass fat 1995-2015", out.width="100%", out.height="50%",fig.align='center', fig.pos='H'}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata","genetictrend.pdf", package="Exemplary"), auto_pdf = T)
```

Several stakeholders derive from the decreasing levels of carcass fat that Swiss beef cattle does not show any improvements in the trait early maturity. 


One possibility to improve early maturity is to use early maturity in a breeding program. 
Early maturity must be preciseley defined and efficiently measurable to include it in a breeding program.

## Definition of Early Maturity {#defem}



The derivation of one trait to another requires that the involved traits are closely correlated. 
Therefore carcass fat should be highly correlated with early maturity.
The assumed correlation is based on the theoretical knowledge about growth and body composition in beef cattle.
Usually muscles grow in an earlier stadium of growth than fat tissue [@Thonney2015].
This indicates that carcass fat is usually the limiting factor for early maturity in beef cattle.
Based on this knowledge of beef growth, carcass fat could be a usefull trait to derive early maturity.
Therefore "Mutterkuh Schweiz", the Swiss beef breeders association, has introduced a breeding value for carcass fat in Summer 2018.
