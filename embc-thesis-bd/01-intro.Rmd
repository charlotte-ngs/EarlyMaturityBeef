# Introduction {#intro}

## Background

Up until summer 2018, the Swiss beef cattle breeders association has been focusing their genetic evaluations mainly on growth rate and carcass conformation. 
Lately it has been observed that carcass fat is decreasing at least for some beef cattle breeds. The decrease of carcass fat leads to a price reduction of the carcass [@Hospenthal2016].
Several stakeholders derive from the decreasing levels of carcass fat that Swiss beef cattle does not show any improvements in the trait early maturity. 
This thesis builds on the following definition of early maturity: Animals mature early if they reach the state of carcass maturity faster than others but get the same price at the slaughterhouse.
One possibility to improve early maturity is to breed for it in a breeding program by using an appropriate strategy.
Two strategies were proposed which had the goal to breed for early maturity in Switzerland:

1. Carcass fat as auxiliary trait (CFAT)

2. Index over carcass traits (IOCT)

In strategy Carcass fat as auxiliary trait, early maturity is inteded to be derived from the breeding value carcass fat. 
The breeding value carcass fat is based on the trait carcass fat, which classifies different levels of fat coverage on beef carcasses (see Figure \@ref(fig:cfgraphic)).
The derivation of one trait to another requires that the involved traits are closely correlated [@Falconer1996].
Therefore carcass fat should be highly correlated with early maturity in order to be an effective auxiliary trait.
The assumed correlation is based on the theoretical knowledge about growth and body composition in beef cattle [@Thonney2015].
Usually muscles grow in an earlier stadium of growth than fat tissue (see Figure \@ref(fig:growthcompgraphic)).
This indicates that carcass fat is usually the limiting factor for early maturity in beef cattle.
Based on this knowledge of beef growth, carcass fat could be a usefull trait to derive early maturity.
Therefore "Mutterkuh Schweiz", the Swiss beef breeders association, has introduced a breeding value for carcass fat in Summer 2018.
