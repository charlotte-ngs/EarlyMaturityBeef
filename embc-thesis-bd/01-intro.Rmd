## Background

Up until summer 2018, the Swiss beef cattle breeders association has been focusing their genetic evaluations mainly on growth rate and carcass conformation. 
Lately it has been observed that carcass fat is decreasing at least for some beef cattle breeds, which leads to a price reduction of the carcass [@Hospenthal2016]. (Hier noch Graph zeigen mit Entwicklung carcass fat over years in switzerland, Sophie fragen)

Several stakeholders derive from the decreasing levels of carcass fat that Swiss beef cattle does not show any improvements in the trait early maturity.
