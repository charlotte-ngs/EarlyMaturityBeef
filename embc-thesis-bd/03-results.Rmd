# Results {#results}

There are results of the index weights, the genetic gains and the rank correlations.
All of these results are presented for the breeds Angus and Limousin.

## Index {#indexresults}

The index was determined by the economic weights for the six carcass traits (see Section \@ref(index)).
These economic weights in Sfr. per trait unit are shown in Table \@ref(tab:ecweightstab).
Additionally the economic weights are shown corrected for each trait's genetic standard deviation in the Swiss beef population (see Figure \@ref(fig:ecweightsgensdfig)).
This correction allows to compare the economic weights not only between breeds but also between traits.

Figure \@ref(fig:ecweightsgensdfig) shows that carcass conformation was the most important trait for both animal groups and both breeds, followed by carcass fat.
The economic weights for carcass weight showed generally the lowest absolute values and were all negative.
The negative values for carcass weight are due to the payment system CHTAX.
There, price reductions only occur when the carcass weight is too high, but never when carcass weight is too low (see Figures \@ref(fig:cwaprice) and \@ref(fig:cwcprice)).
The economic weights for the traits of group *calves* were higher than for the group *adults*.
Their higher importance were due to the higher relative price differences per kg carcass weight in CHTAX. 
Between the breeds Angus and Limousin existed general differences in their economic weights.
These differences behaved the same for both animal groups *adults* and *calves*.
Firstly, the economic weights for carcass weight were more negative in Limousin than in Angus.
This was due to higher population means in carcass weight in Limousin than in Angus (see Table \@ref(tab:cwmeansd)).
Secondly, the economic weights for carcass conformation were higher in Angus than in Limousin.
This was due to higher population means of carcass conformation in Limousin than in Angus (see Figure \@ref(fig:ccfrequencies)).
Thirdly, the economic weights for carcass fat were higher in Limousin than in Angus.
This was due to population means closer to class 3 of carcass fat in Angus than in Limousin (see Figure \@ref(fig:cffrequencies)).
Additionally the economic weight for carcass fat in the animal group adults and in the breed Angus was negative.
This was due to the population mean of adults carcass fat in Angus, which was slightly above the optimum carcass fat class 3.

## Genetic Gain {#gengainresults}

Both breeding strategies led to positive genetic gains (see Figure \@ref(fig:gengainagggenotypefig)).
This shows that breeding for them would result in generally higher prices per kg carcass weight for beef carcasses in the Swiss breed populations Angus and Limousin.
The genetic gain was higher for the strategy *Index over carcass traits* than for the strategy *Carcass fat as auxilliary trait*.
This was due to more assumed available information for the breeders to breed for the aggregate genotype when using the strategy *Index over carcass traits*.
The difference is shown in the two definitions of the selection indices which are shown as Equation \@ref(selindindex) and Equation \@ref(selindcf).
The difference in genetic gain between the two strategies was lower in Limousin than in Angus.
This was due to a lower population mean of carcass fat in Limousin than in Angus (see Figure \@ref(fig:ccfrequencies)).

Strategy *Carcass fat as auxilliary trait* showed a relativeley high genetic gain in this trait, which was more favorable for the mean aggregate genotype of Limousin than of Angus (see Figure \@ref(fig:corrgengaincffig)).
The correlated genetic gains of this strategy did only differ slightly between breeds.
There the breed-specific economic weights (see Table \@ref(tab:ecweightstab)) apparently had little impact on the correlated genetic gains.
The correlated genetic gains for carcass conformation were positive in the group *adults* but negative in the group *calves*.
These gains were on low absolute levels in comparison to the gains in carcass fat.
This was due to positive genetic correlations between carcass fat and the *adults* carcass conformation.
And it was due to negative genetic correlations between carcass fat and the *calves* carcass conformation (see Table \@ref(tab:genvarcov)).
The correlated genetic gains of carcass weight behaved very similarly to the correlated genetic gains of carcass conformation.
This shows that the genetic correlations of carcass conformation are close to the genetic correlations of carcass weight.

Strategy *Index over carcass traits* led to negative genetic gains of carcass weight (see Figure \@ref(fig:corrgengainindexfig)).
This was due to generally low genetic correlations between carcass weight and the other traits.
Additionally it represented the negative economic weights for carcass weight (see Table \@ref(tab:ecweightstab)).
The correlated gains for the strategy *Index over carcass traits* differed substantially between Angus and Limousin.
Firstly, the correlated genetic gains of carcass weight was more negative in Limousin than in Angus.
This was due to the more negative economic weights of carcass weight in Limousin than in Angus and it was due to the positive genetic correlation between carcass weight *calves* and carcass weight *adults*.
Secondly, the gain of carcass conformation was higher in Angus than in Limousin
The inverse could be observed for the gain of carcass fat.
These values followed the respective economic weights of these traits in the aggregate genotype.
There were two observations which could not be explained by the economic weights.
Firstly, the correlated genetic gain of carcass fat *adults* for Angus was positive.
This was due to a high correlation between carcass fat *adults* and carcass fat *calves*.
Secondly, the gain of carcass conformation was negative for Limousin.
This was due to positive correlations between carcass conformation and carcass weight.

## Rank Correlations {#rankcorresults}

The ranks of the 83 Angus animals and the 354 Limousin animals were computed using their breeding values of carcass fat adults, carcass fat calves and using their index value.
These ranks were generally very different for the same animals, which is shown by the massive scattering in Figures \@ref(fig:rankcorcfaangus), \@ref(fig:rankcorcfcangus), \@ref(fig:rankcorcfalimousin) and \@ref(fig:rankcorcfclimousin).
This massive scattering qualifies the values of the rank correlation coefficients and it reduces their validity.
The correlation coefficients were higher between the ranks in carcass fat calves and the ranks in the index, than between carcass fat adults and the ranks of the index.
This was due to the higher economic weights in the index for carcass fat calves than for carcass fat adults.
Limousin showed higher rank correlations between both carcass fat traits and the index than Angus.
The rank correlations between carcass fat and index of the Angus animals were not higher than 0.2.
This was due to the higher economic weights for carcass fat in Limousin than in Angus.
