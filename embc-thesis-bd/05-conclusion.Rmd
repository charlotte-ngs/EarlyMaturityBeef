# Conclusion {#conc}
Strategies *Index over carcass traits* and *Carcass fat as auxiliary trait* are both suitable to improve early maturity in Swiss beef cattle.
Strategy *Index over carcass traits* is more effective in breeding for early maturity than strategy *Carcass fat as auxiliary trait*.
Both strategies show considerable differences in the predicted improvement of different carcass traits.
Using strategy *Index over carcass traits* would improve early maturity by increasing carcass traits according to the breed-specific potentials in increasing the average price per kg carcass weight.
For example, Angus would mainly be increased in carcass conformation and carcass weight ,and Limousin would mainly be increased in carcass fat.
Strategy *Carcass fat as auxiliary trait* would mainly increase carcass fat in both breeds.
In Angus this would not be favorable, because this beef breed population is already sufficiently high in carcass fat in the payment system CHTAX.
Strategy *Index over carcass traits* could be improved by considering the economic importance of *adults* and *calves* in its economic weights.
Additionally, it may be further improved through the introduction of production models which consider costs.

The deviation in age at slaughter (DAGE) from @Berry2017 is an alternative way to improve early maturity.
In a further study the presented strategies would have to be compared to the DAGE.
