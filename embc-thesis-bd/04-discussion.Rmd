## Index {#indexdiscussion}

The resulting economic weights per genetic standard deviation indicate that the carcass traits of *calves* were economically more important than the carcass traits of *adults*.
Separate breeding values for carcass traits in different animal groups are very unusual.
They do not exist in related studies [@Aby2012; @Kause2014].
Here, the stronger weighting of *calves* was a consequence of the payment system CHTAX.
There relative prices per kg carcass weight were more sensitive to changes in carcass traits in *calves* than in *adults*.
Unfortunateley the higher economic weights for *calves* than for *adults* did not represent the relative economic importance of these animal groups in Switzerland.
Adult beef animals are slaughtered in higher numbers than calves in Switzerland.
For example 233'245 adult animals (cows excluded) and 215'187 calves have been slaughtered 2017 in Switzerland [Agristat2018].
Measured in carcass weight this difference is more distinct with 65'154 t for *adults* versus 27'050 t for *calves* [Agristat2018].
Therefore, the used model to compute the economic weights could be improved by correcting them for the relative economic importance of *calves* and *adults* in Switzerland.
For both *calves* and *adults* carcass conformation was the most important carcass trait in the index, followed by carcass fat and carcass weight.
That carcass conformation was more important than carcass fat followes from the payment system CHTAX, where carcass conformation is a maximum trait and carcass fat is an optimum trait [@Proviande2015].
In the computation of economic weights, trait improvements are defined as an increase in population mean [@brascamp1985].
An increase in population mean may more easily improve a maximum trait than an optimum trait, which could be better improved by a reduction in the population distribution's standard deviation.
The ranking of these carcass trait was also observed in the indices computed by @Amer2001 and @Aby2014.
In these studies not CHTAX was used as material but the EUROP payment system.
Like in CHTAX, carcass fat is an optimum and carcass conformation is a maximum trait in EUROP.
However high levels in carcass fat are far more punished in EUROP than in CHTAX.
This explains the negative weights of carcass fat observed by @Amer2001 and @Aby2014 in contrast to the generally positive values in this Master thesis.

Carcass weight was a minimum trait with a large range missing any price differences (0 - 140 kg for calves and 0 - 290 kg for adults).
This large range with missing price differences considerably reduced the importance of carcass weight in the index.
In the study of @Aby2012 carcass weight was the most important trait in the computed index.
The most important reason for this different result may be that in this Master thesis the unit [(Sfr. / kg carcass weight) / trait unit] was used for the economic weights.
The other studies used the unit [Euro / (trait unit and animal)].
Additionally production costs were not considered in this Master Thesis in contrast to @Aby2012.
Carcass weight was not only the least important trait in the index, but also negativeley weighted.
This is even more unusual and could not be observed in any other related study ??.
Nevertheless negative weights for carcass weight may be favorable in Switzerland.
In Switzerland beef animals are slaughter at much younger age than in other European countries, because Swiss consumers prefer small meat cuts [@Hospenthal??].
However, negative weights for carcass weight may also hinder breeding for early maturity in Switzerland.
The breeding values of carcass weight, like carcass conformation and carcass fat are corrected for age at slaughter in the multivariate BLUP model (see Section \@ref(matgengain)).
This correction leads to increased carcass weights for animals with a low age at slaughter.
Thus, these animals get reduced index values and will less often be used as parents for the next generation.
Therefore negative economic weights for carcass fat apparently do not favor the wish to breed for early maturity in Switzerland.
These weights could be adapted to the relative values of the literature, but then the index would loose one of its strengths.
This strength is the transparence and comprehensibility of its creation.
Another strength of the index is its ability to facilitate breeding adapted to the characteristics of different breeds.
The index's economic weights computed in this Master thesis accounted for the specific potentials of the breed populations Angus and Limousin in Switzerland.
While Angus has high potential to increase carcass conformation in its population, Limousin has high potential to increase carcass fat in its population.
These different potentials led to different economic weights for these traits in Angus and Limousin.
The economic weights for carcass conformation was higher for Angus compared to Limousin and the economic weights for carcass fat was higher for Limousin compared to Angus.
This pattern was also observed by other studies [@Aby2012].
@Aby2012 actually computed economic weights for the two groups *intensive breeds* (including Limousin) and *extensive breeds* (including Angus).
For the comparison to the results of this Master thesis Angus was assumed to be exchangable with the group *extensive breeds* and Limousin was assumed to be exchangable with the group *intensive breeds*.
