## Skeleton Plan
So far, we have a rough skeleton of a project plan. The first steps of this plan contain the following items

* Work out a detailed project plan
* Collect the relevant literature on the topic of this project
* Put together a literature review
* Describe the situation as it is both on a national and an interantional level.
