## Target

* Problem: Negative trend in early maturity.

* Here maturity is readiness for slaughter.

* Bad performence in early maturity --> increased costs.

* Qualitas commissioned by Mutterkuh Schweiz to solve this problem.

* My part: Which proposed strategies are most suitable to breed for early maturity in beef cattle?

\note{
Welcome to my presentation about strategies to breed for early maturity in beef cattle. My name is Silvan and I write my master thesis in association with Qualitas AG and Mutterkuh Schweiz. Mutterkuh Schweiz the Swiss beef breeders association is a customer of Qualitas AG and has a problem to be solved.
The problem is, that Swiss beef cattle is getting worse in early maturity "FrÃ¼hreife".
This trait is an economically important trait for beef cattle breeders.
With early maturity I mean the readiness for slaughter. 
For example, imagine two beef carcasses which are exactly the same and get exatly the same price. 
For one carcass an animal has lived 250 d and for the other 230 d. 
Then the one that only lived for 230 d is the one which earlier mature than the other.
It is obvious that the one which only lived for 230 d led to much less costs for the breeder than the one which lived for 250 d.

## Strategies

**1. Derivation of early maturity from carcass fat corrected by age at slaughter.**

**2. Index over carcass traits corrected by age at slaughter to breed for early maturity.**

\note{
Qualtitas tries to solve the problem by breeding for animals whith good performances in early maturity. 
However it is not an easily measurable trait, which makes breeding for it difficult.
Probably due this reason breeding for early maturity is not established in any major breeding program.
Even the word early maturity has not been present in any scientific paper I read about beef breeding.
Nevertheless my supervisors have found 4 possible strategies to breed for early maturity.
I will evaluate the two most feasible and promising strategies in my master thesis.
The first strategy is already implemented. 
It uses the breeding value carcass fat which is corrected by age at slaughter to derive from it early maturity.
The second strategy is not implemented and tries to use an index over all breeding values for carcass traits to breed for early maturity.
}

## Carcass traits

* Data from Proviande

* Carcass fat (CF) -> How fatty?

* Carcass conformation (CC) -> How meaty?

* Carcass weight (CW) -> How heavy?

* Calves = < 180 d old

* Adults = > 180 < ? d old

\note{
Both are very promising because the data which they use is already available. 
Since 1992 Proviande routineley records data from beef carcass traits.
These carcass traits are carcass fat, carcass conformation and carcass weight. 
Of all of them there already exist two breeding values. One for carcasses which were calves and one for carcasses which were adults (cows not included)).
}

## 1. Strategy (carcass fat)

* Breeding values for carcass fat to derive early maturity

* Probably correlated with early maturity

* Corrected by age at slaughter -> *How early fatty*?

```{r eval=FALSE}
#setwd("~/Documents/EarlyMaturityBeef/20182310_Presentation/rmd")
library(knitr)
include_graphics("GrowthComposition.png")
```

\note{
The two breeding values for carcass fat corrected by age at slaughter could be used to derive early maturity, because these traits are assumed to be closely correlated. 
This assumption is based on practical experience from beef breeders and on the theoretical knowledge of beef cattle growth. 
The amount of fat tissue during growth is usually the limiting factor for carcass maturity.
}

## 2. Strategy (index)

* Index as selection criterion

* Main result until this stage of master thesis

$$I=\sum{a_mu_m}$$

where 

$a$ is an economic weight,

$u$ is an estimated breeding value and

$m$ indicates the breeding values CFa, CFc, CCa, CCc, CWa and CWc.

CF = Carcass fat 

CC = Carcass conformation 

CW = Carcass weight 

a = adults 

c = calves.

\note{
In the second strategy the selection is based on an index, including all six estimated breeding values for carcass traits and six economic weighing factors.
This index is the main result I have until this stage of the thesis.
The estimated breeding values are available, but the economic weights not.
My task was to compute the economic weights to produce an index.
There I assume that breeding occurs within breeds which requires a separate index for each beef cattle breed.
To get the best overview on all beef breeds I chose to compute the index for the breeds Angus and Limousin. 
These two breeds are very different in carcass traits. 
}

# Economic Weights

* Unit Sfr. / breeding value unit (e.g. Sfr. / carcass fat class)

* Scaling up from a small change in population mean

\note{
Economic weights must have the unit Swiss francs per breeding value unit.
For example the economic weight for carcass fat has the unit Swiss francs per additional carcass fat class.
However when breeding the chance to get an increase of a whole unit is not realistic, at least for carcass fat and carcass conformation.
Therefore I computed it by taking the ratio of the change in profit, when the population mean is increased divided by a small increase in population mean.
Then I scaled it up to a whole unit change in mean.
However I did not have enough information to get the true change in profit for a change in population mean.
Therefore I have approximated the change in profit by only using the difference in price per kg carcass weight.
For example you get a certain amount of Swiss francs more for carcass fat class 3 than 4.
Additionally the price changes are not the same over the whole scale.
Therefore I had to compute the mean change in price if I increase the mean of the population.
To do so I had to get the initial distribution of the population over the carcass trait.
The initial distribution is different for each breed Angus and Limousin and for adults and calves.
To conserve the shape of the distribution when increasing the population mean, I approximated a normal distribution to the discrete distribution

## Carcass fat

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#setwd("~/Documents/EarlyMaturityBeef/20182310_Presentation/rmd")
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
LM <- "LM_economic_values"
LM <- read.table(file = a, sep=";", header=TRUE)%>%
  select(c("cCF","aCF"))
LM <- as.vector(t(a))
LM
LM <- "LM_economic_values"
LM<- read.table(file = a, sep=";", header=TRUE)%>%
  select(c("cCF","aCF"))
LM <- as.vector(t(LM))
LM

# Plot
g <- ggplot(LM,aes(Class,frequency))
g +facet_grid(~Group) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.5, aes(fill=Category), position="dodge")+
  theme_classic()
```


## Carcass Conformation


## Carcass Weight



## Genetic gain

Dependent on

* Generation intervall

* Selection Intensity

* Standard Deviation of the selection criterion

* Accuracy of the selection criterion

* Selection criterion here = Estimated breeding value for carcass fat.

* Bulmer effect [Bulmer] taken into account

\note{
To evaluate the two strategies, I will use a well-established tool: The genetic gain. 
The genetic gain predicts the development of traits under a modelled selection scenarium. 
Usually it is expressed in trait unit per year. 
The genetic gain is dependent on the generation intervall which determines how fast selection occurs, 
on the selection intensity, which determines how large the proportion of the selected population is which will produce the offspring for the next generation, 
on the standard deviation of selected criterion in the population which is the potential for breeding 
and on the accuracy of selection which is a measure of how similar the selected parents are to their progeny in the selection criterion.

## CHTAX

Whithin carcass categories price reductions if:

- Carcass fat class $\neq$ 3 (optimum)

- Carcass conformation $\neq$ C (maximum)

- Carcass weight above certain limit (dependent on carcass category)
