## How to use notes

This is some text on a R markdown slide. We want to show how notes can be added. The source for adding notes was taken from SO at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44906264/add-speaker-notes-to-beamer-presentations-using-rmarkdown

\note{
On this slide I am adding a few notes that are relevant for the speaker.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
