## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## R chunks

With "alt" + "cmd" + "i" you can create a r chunk:
```{r}

```

## Citations
This section explains how we do literature citations together with Mendeley. 

1. First we have to export the *.bib-file for our papers by either
    * setting up automatic *.bib-generation in Mendeley-Desktop via the menu `Mendeley Desktop` > `Preferences` or by
    * explicitly exporting the *.bib file from one paper by right click on the record and hit `Export`
2. As the next step, we copy the *.bib file into the rmd-directory. 
3. The paper can then be cited using the key of the bib-record from the *.bib-file.

For more details see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html

The following text is now citing our paper [@Eriksson2003b]. 

The next paper that we are citing is [@Williams2010a]


# Glossary
* __Net growth__ Mean gain in weight in kg per d. ( $carcass weight - 0.5 * birth weight) * 1000 / age$ [@Kunz2018].

* __Carcass weight__ (SG) In the case of no legal definition, carcass weight should be defined as the hot weight of both half carcasses after being bled and eviscerated and after removal of skin, removal of external genitalia, the limbs at the carpus and tarsus, head, tail, kidneys and kidney fats and the udder [@ICAR]. It is about what ICAR has as definition in the Swiss law [@EDI2013]. Phenotypic carcass weight to produce a breeding value carcass weight. The weight data are collected in meat factories by a balance. It contains information about the enviromental and the genetic effects. Heritability of 0.22 for KV and 0.3 for MT show that breeding for carcass weight is possible. Breeding for a specific carcass weight is impossible. [@KunzS.2018]. The higher the breeding value, the higher the potential carcass weight of the progeny?

* __Early maturity__ Either property of carcass fat coverage (optimum is class 3). Or property, how early an animal can be slaughtered when conditions (no price reductions per kg carcass weight) are met. Often expressed in the unit days. Should not be mixed up with sexual maturity. However corresponding to Andreas Landolt it may be linked to each other [@Kunz2018].

* __Conformation__ (F) Conformation is determined by the method CH-TAX. It tells you how much meat there is compared to the body weight [@ABZ2017]. 

* __Weaning date__ Date when the calf does not get any milk from its mother anymore.

* __Tierverkehrsdatenbank__ (TVD) There all animals are given a unique ID and informations about phenotypic performance, breeding values and relationship degrees are conserved. Identitas AG is owner of the data in Switzerland.

* __Carcass category__ Category of different types of carcasses depends on their age, sexual maturity and sex. MT = Bull ungeschaufelt _Was sind Schaufeln?_, MA = Bull older, OB = Ox until 4 Schaufeln, RG = young bull until 4 Schaufeln, RV = young bull/ young cow, cow until max 4 Schaufeln, VK = cow, JB = Young bull, KV = Calf [@ABZ2017]

* __CHTAX__ Tool to categorize visually carcasses in different categories, it describes the trait carcass conformation. The price of the carcass depends on the category and the carcass weight. C = very well fleshed, H = well fleshed, T = medium fleshed, A = poorly fleshed, X = very poorly fleshed [@ABZ2017].

* __Genetic correlation__ How much are different traits genetically linked to each other. Also called shared heritability. If the term is 0 the traits do not share any heritability with each other. If the term is 1 the traits share all the heritability with each other. Means: If one trait is higher in the next generation, the other will be higher by the same proportion. (proportional to each other). If the term is negative e.g. -1, the proportionality will be negative. If one trait is higher in the next generation the other one will be positive. 

* __Carcass fat__ (FET) There are 5 classes of fat coverages: 1 = non-covered, 2 = partially covered, 3 = evenly covered, 4 = strongly covered, 5 = overfatty. The higher the breeding value of FET, the higher potentially the fat class of its offspring [@KunzS.2018].

* __Estimation of variance components__ Enables the calculation of heritabilities https://qualitasag.ch/neu-im-juli-2018-update-zuchtwertschaetzung-schlachtmerkmale/. Usually with a sample. You have multiple phenotypic values per farm, then you can calculate the variance (of the same animal?) accross different year over the same farm, you can calculate the variance of a estimator in the slaughterhouse per animal?.

* __Qualität-DB__ ?

* __Pedigree__ Pedigree of the animal[@VonRohr2017]. A tabulation of ids and names of an individual’s ancestors. Pedigree information is used to establish genetic relationships among individuals to use in genetic evaluations [@ICAR]. 

* __Mixed linear model__ Trying to remove effects of the environment on the model by calculating it into the model. Farm is random effekt because there is not enough data to calculate its effect reliably [@Kunz2018].

* __Additive genetic effect__ The effect of the genetics of an animal that are inherited to its offspring. Not included is the dominance and epistasy effect [@VonRohr2017].

* __Animal model__ Is a version of BLUP, where the phenotypic observation of an animal depends on the breeding value of the animal and the breeding value of the animal is dependent on the breeding values of all its relatives. Also the breeding value is corrected by the breeding value of its mating partners [@VonRohr2017].

* __Genetic groups__ Groups of animals with unknown parents. Groups are formed according to age (year born), country of origin and/or breed composition (if more than one breed is included) [@ICAR]. Example and purpose?

* __Phantom parents__ ?

* __Basis animal__ Animals in the pedigree that do not have parents according to the model?? [@Burgisser2018]. Or: One of the animals that create as their mean the population mean. E.G. In the german breeding valuation the animals from 2006-2010 are used to calculate the population mean for the breeding values 2014. They change each year in Germany [@Vit].

* __Bankkalb__ (KV) Why differentiate breeding values of KV and MT?

* __Banktier__ (MT) 

* __Selection path__ ?

* __Variance components__ ?

* __Software VCE__ ?

* __Software Mix99__ ?

* __Residual__ A residual is the vertical difference between a regression line and the observed value. 

* __Variance__ ($\sigma^2$) It is the square mean deviation of the expected value. Here we use the empiric variance. It is calculated like in this example: We have a number row (vector) of:
```{r}
vec_a <- c(1,3,5,6,8,5)
```
We take the arithmetic mean out of the vector values:
```{r}
mvec_a <- mean(vec_a)
mvec_a
```
We calculate the square differences (absolute) of the observations to the mean/Erwartungswert.
```{r}
sdvec_a <- (mvec_a-vec_a)^2
sdvec_a
```
We take the sum of the square differences and divide it by the degrees of freedom which is the number of terms in the vector - 1.
```{r}
sum(sdvec_a)/(length(vec_a)-1)

```
Should be the same like
```{r}
var(vec_a)
```

The advantage of using R-code-chunks to do the examples is that computations are done automatically and do not lead to errors. Furthermore, we do not have to do computations explicitly, but we can use functions such as `sum` and `mean` which are readily available. 

* __Standard deviation__ It is usually calculated as the square root of the variance. It is the mean absolute deviation to the mean of all observations or the Erwartungswert (when stetig) [@Kalisch2011]. Like in the example of variance:

```{r}
var_vec_a <- var(vec_a)
stdev<- var_vec_a^0.5
stdev
```

* __Genetic variances__ ($\sigma_g$) Phenotypic variances that can be explained by the genetics of the animal (by its pedigree) [@VonRohr2017].

* __Phenotypic variances__ ($\sigma_p$) The variance of a measured trait in a population.

* __Residual variances__ ($\sigma_e$) The variance of a measured trait in a population that can not be explained by the relationship of the animals.

* __Farm*year variances__ Phenotypic variances that can be explained by the environment (of which data is available like farm and year) of the animal. Different feed, managents, location [@Hospenthal2016].

* __Heritability__ ($h^2$) Selection success (mean of progeny) divided by selection differential (mean of selected parents). The higher, the more the trait is dependent on the genetics of the population. It is the genetic additive variance divided by the phenotypic variance [@VonRohr2017].

* __Selection differential__ (S) The measure of the selection applied, which is the average superiority of the selected parents compared to the population mean [@Falconer1996].

* __Intensity of selection__ (i) The standardized selection differential, corrected by the phenotypic standard deviation of the values of a trait in the population. If you can assume a normal distribution you can derivate it from the proportion of the population selected as parents [@Falconer1996].

* __Phenotypic standard deviation__ ($\sigma_{P}$) You have values that have been measured for a certain trait. Of those values you can calculate the mean deviation of the mean of the values. This is the phenotypic standard deviation of a trait of a population [@Falconer1996].

* __Response to selection__ (R) $R=ih^2\sigma_{P}$. Is the difference of the population mean over a period of time. You can predict it using the information of the deterministic breeding plan: Intensity of selection, the variance of the aggregate genotypes and breeding accuracy [@Falconer1996].

* __Basis difference__ ? 

* __Breeding value estimation__ (ZWS) Traditionally we use informations about phenotypic performances and degrees of relationships to estimate the breeding value. Now informations about the genetics of an animal can also be used [@VonRohr2017]. Also called genetic evaluation [@ICAR].

* __Training animal__ Animal with own performance[@Burgisser2018].

* __Abbreviations Breeding valuation Mutterkuh Schweiz__ ccc = Conformation Bankkälber, cca = Conformation Banktiere, cfc = Fat coverage Bankkälber, cfa = Fat coverage Banktiere, cwc = carcass weight Bankkälber, cwa = carcass weight Banktiere. (c1 = ?, c2 = conformation, f2 = fat coverage, w2 = carcassweight, c3 = calf, a3 = animal) [@Kunz2018].

* __Abbreviations cow breeds__ AN = Angus, AU = Aubrac, BV = Braunvieh, CH = Charolais, LM = Limousin, SM = Simmental [@Kunz2018].

* __Typify__ Genomics not necessary yet.

* __Data validation/selection__ Making sure that the data is describing what we want to look at and deciding which data will be used for further analysis.

* __Estimated breeding value__ (EBV, û) EBVs are expressed in the units of measurement for each particular trait.  They are shown as + ive or - ive differences between an individual animal's genetics difference and the genetic base to which the animal is compared.  For example, a bull with an EBV of +50 kg for 600-Day Weight is estimated to have genetic merit 50 kg above the breed base of 0 kg.  Since the breed base is set to an historical benchmark, the average EBVs of animals in each year drop over time as a result of genetic progress within the breed.
The absolute value of any EBV is not critical, but rather the differences in EBVs between animals.  Particular animals should be viewed as being "above or below breed average" for a particular trait.   http://abri.une.edu.au/online/pages/understanding_ebvs_char.htm. The EBV is an estimate of the ability of an individual to produce superior offspring; based on one or more measurements of performance, using phenotypic values, taken on the animal itself or, more commonly, on a number of its relatives https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/true+breeding+value.

* __Breeding valuation carcass traits__ Fat coverage, conformation, carcass weight [@Kunz2018].

* __Breeding valuation early maturity__ Only dependent on age and carcass fat [@Kunz2018].

* __Fat coverage__ Trait describing the amount of fat on the meat of a carcass [@Kunz2018].

* __Slaughterhouse__ Where animals are slaughtered and processed.There are two categories of slaughterhouses in Switzerland: big and small. If there are more than 1500 slaughter units (per day?), it belongs to the category big, which has more reglementations to fulfill [@Gresset2017].

* __Slaughter unit__ I determined as 1 cow, 1 heifer/young bull, 2 calves (Mail 2016).

* __Degree of freedom__ All possible values a random variable can express.

* __ISET__ ? Von Aktennotiz 16. Mai

* __SHB__ ? Von Aktennotiz 16. Mai

* __FW__ ? Von Aktennotiz 16. Mai

* __IVF__ ? Von Aktennotiz 16. Mai

* __Nettozuwachs__ (NZW) Wie genau definiert? durchschnittlicher Zuwachs in kg pro Tag seit Geburt? 

* __RH__ ? Von Aktennotiz 16. Mai

* __DAGE__ Deviation (genetic difference) in age at slaughter of each animal relative to its contemporaries for constant carcass weight and constant subcutaneous carcass fatness. Animals with different subcutaneus carcass fatness then not comparable? Comes from concept residual feed intake Sitzung 23.8.17.

* __Residual feed intake__ (RFI) is defined as the difference (i.e. residual) between measured and predicted feed intake across a regression of both. Found in the book section of @Berry2015

* __Predicted feed intake__ is based on performance and various energy sinks (metabolic live weight, average daily gain, body composition) of the individual.

* __Beef herdbook__ (FLHB) The FLHB a part of Mutterkuh Schweiz. Its goal is to achieve genetic and economic improvements in suckle cow husbandry by collecting and analysing data for breeding [@FLHB2017].

* __Beef performance control__ (FLEK) FLEK is a phenotypic assessment of cattle. The traits assessed are growing performance of calves and reproduction performance of the dam [@FLHB2017].

* __Linear scoring (LB) LB is a phenotypic assessment of cattle. The traits assessed give information about the look of the dam or bull [@FLHB2017]. The visual assessment of an animal for one or more morphological characteristics using a linear scale which represents the biological extremes in the population of animals under consideration [@ICAR].

* __Population mean of breeding value__ ($\mu$) Lies usually at 100, when relative breeding values are used. It is calculated as the mean of the basis animals. If an animal has a breeding value over 100 its offspring has the potential to be on average better in this trait than the average population [@KunzS.2018]. 

* __QM Swiss meat__ Meat that originates from animals kept on farms complying with ÖLN rules.

* __Covariable__ Connected to regressions (Stricker 2004). I still can not imagine it.

* __Adjusted traits__ Traits adjusted to facilitate more meaningful comparisons such as 365 day weights or eye muscle area adjusted to constant weight or age [@ICAR]. Adjusted by covariables?

* __Fixed / random effects__ When a sample (? What kind) exhausts the population, the corresponding variable (?) is fixed; when the sample is a small (i.e., negligible) part of the population the corresponding variable is random [@ICAR]. ?

* __Best linear unbiased prediction__ (BLUP) Is a solution of an equation system with many unknown variables. The solution is the breeding value of an animal. The equation system is fed by phenotypic performances of the observed animals and its relatives, the degree of relationship and environmental informations of the animals [@VonRohr2017]. The properties of BLUP are incorporated in the name: (B) est means it maximizes the correlation between true (u) and predicted breeding value (û) or minimizes the prediction error variance (PEV) = var(u-û). (L) inear means predictors are linear functions of observations (e.g. body weight correlates linearly with the breeding value body weight - example Silvan created). (U)nbiased estimation of realized values for a random variable, such as animal breeding values, and of estimable functions of fixed effects are unbiased (E(u=û)). (P) rediction involves prediction of true breeding value. BLUP is based on the equation for a mixed linear model: $y=Xb+Zu+e$. $y$ is a vector of the size of number of records. $b$ is a vector of the size of number of levels of fixed effects. $u$ is the vector of the size of number of random animal effects and $e$ is the vector of random residual effects.

* __Multi-trait model__ The breeding values of different traits are not calculated independently but influence each other in using the knowledge about their shared heritability also called covariance. https://qualitasag.ch/neu-im-juli-2018-update-zuchtwertschaetzung-schlachtmerkmale/.

* __Maternal genetic effect__ A random effect that describes how the mother can have an influence on the performance of its progeny. Is used to correct the breeding values of its progeny.

* __Aggregate genotype__ A calculated index of all breeding values to enable the simultaneous improvement of multiple breeding values. https://qualitasag.ch/blick-hinter-die-kulissen-der-zuchtwertschaetzung-fuer-schlachtmerkmale-beim-rind/. The true, overall breeding value arrived at by the addition of the true breeding values for each selection objective with each true breeding value multiplied by the relevant net economic value. https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/true+breeding+value. In Pimentel 2012 called breeding goal.

* __True breeding value__ (u) Genetic merit of an individual which can be conceptually defined as twice the average deviation of its offspring from the population mean when mated randomly to an infinite population. https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/true+breeding+value

* __Certainty__ The more own or relative informations you have about a trait, the better you can compare the animals with each other and the more certain the breeding values are [@Vit]

* __Phenotype__ The set of observable charasteristics of an animal [@ICAR].

* __Predictor trait__ A trait that can be measured easily on an animal and which is highly correlated to a relevant production trait. An example is scrotal circumference in the case of male fertility [@ICAR].

* __Progeny Test__ he evaluation procedure of an animal based on the performance of its progeny [@ICAR].

* __Steer__ Castrated male [@ICAR].

* __Base Population__ A group of animals with unknown parents in genetic evaluations, whose EBV’s are set to zero [@ICAR]. Usually the base population consists of animals of the same breed.https://qualitasag.ch/blick-hinter-die-kulissen-der-zuchtwertschaetzung-fuer-schlachtmerkmale-beim-rind/

* __Breed__ Animals with a common origin and selection history. Animals within a breed have characteristics that distinguish them from other breeds or groups of animals within that same species [@ICAR].

* __Breeding farms__ Farms which specialize in the production of animals to be used as sires and dams on other farms which rear animals for animal producing animal products [@ICAR].

* __Calculated or Derived traits__ Traits derived from recorded traits such as food conversion efficiency [@ICAR].

* __Carcass composition__ The proportions of a connective tissue, bone, muscle and fat in a carcass [@ICAR].

* __Carcass grade__ The relative level of  a carcass for certain aspects, such as fatness, colour, maturity and class (e.g. male, female, young, old) [@ICAR].

* __Dressing percentage__ Dressing percentage describes the percent ratio between carcass weight and the live weight taken immediately before slaughter [@ICAR].

* __Empty weights__ Animal weight when it consumes no feed or water for minimum 12 hours prior to weighing [@ICAR].

* __Environmental effects__ Effects which influence the performance of an animal which are not genetic in origin [@ICAR].

* __E-U-R-O-P__ EU carcass conformation system [@ICAR].

* __Founder animal__ The earliest known ancestor of an animal [@ICAR].

* __Generation interval__ ($L$) Average age of parents when the offspring destined to replace
them are born. It should be computed separately for male and female parents [@ICAR] [Falconer1996].

* __Heterosis__ (Hybrid vigor) Amount by which the average performance for a trait in
crossbred calves exceeds the average performance of the two or more purebreds that were mated in that particular cross [@ICAR].

* __Indicator traits__ Traits that do not have direct economic importance, but aid in the prediction of economically important traits [@ICAR].

* __Invariant data__ Data that is constant, such as an animals date of birth [@ICAR].

* __Lean Meat__ Meat with the connective tissue limits, but free of visible fat [@ICAR].

* __Maintenance energy requirement__ The amount of feed energy required per day by an animal to maintain its body weight and support necessary metabolic functions [@ICAR].

* __Meat yield__ The percentage of lean meat in the beef carcass as obtained by dissection [@ICAR].

* __Trait category__ Traits are categorized in two categories when we breed for them. One is called maximizing trait like carcass weight and conformation, where we breed only in one direction (more carcass weight). The other one is called optimizing trait like fat coverage where we try to move the population to an optimum value. https://qualitasag.ch/blick-hinter-die-kulissen-der-zuchtwertschaetzung-fuer-schlachtmerkmale-beim-rind/

* __Post processing__ Breeding values are getting based on their separate breed base e.g. Simmental.

* __Breed invariable__ Tool to assess relative differences in traits across different breeds. https://qualitasag.ch/blick-hinter-die-kulissen-der-zuchtwertschaetzung-fuer-schlachtmerkmale-beim-rind/

* __Genetic trend__ Is calculated by the mean breeding values of following years. Does the basis in this time? (probably yes) https://qualitasag.ch/blick-hinter-die-kulissen-der-zuchtwertschaetzung-fuer-schlachtmerkmale-beim-rind/

* __Sire__ Father animal.

* __Dam__ Mother animal.

* __Heifer__ Female which had no calf yet.

* __Young bull__ Bull which is still in growth.

* __Age at slaughter__ Age of the animal that is slaughtered.

* __Random regression modell__ 

* __Economic weight__ Provide indications as to how much genetic improvement in a specific trait would be worth paying for.

* __String variable__ Vector? (Stricker 2004)

* __Expected value__ The long-run average value of a random variable, that has many possibilities which value it can possess. In other words, each possible value the random variable can assume is multiplied by its probability of occurring, and the resulting products are summed to produce the expected value https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value. In a probability function the expected value is the on the long run most probable value. Usually when we have a sample, we take the arithmetic mean and the variance around the mean and say, that the sample is representative for infinite sampling points. The we can derive a function of probability through the points, which is defined by the mean and the variance of the sample.

* __Index theory__ 

* __Effect level__ For example the fixed effect sex has two levels: male and female.

* __Ancestors__ The progeny you descends from.

* __Yearling weight__ 

* __Genetic standard deviation__ 

* __Index__ Index values are reported as EBVs, in units of relative earning capacity ($’s) for a given market.  They reflect both the short-term profit generated by a sire through the sale of his progeny, and the longer-term profit generated by his daughters in a self-replacing cow herd.  A selection index combines the EBVs with economic information (costs and returns) for specific market and production systems to rank animals based on relative profit values [@ABRI2018].

* __Accuracy of selection__ ($r$) [%] is based on the amount of performance information available on the animal and its close relatives - particularly the number of progeny analysed.  Accuracy is also based on the heritability of the trait and the genetic correlations with other recorded traits.  Hence accuracy indicates the "confidence level" of the EBV.  The higher the accuracy value the lower the likelihood of change in the animal's EBV as more information is analysed for that animal or its relatives [@ABRI2018]. Accuracy is correlation between the true breeding value and the selection criterion (Kurs von Heinz, Wageningen, 16-20 October 2017, Julius van der Werf, Piter Bijma, Mario Calus, Han Mulder). 

* __Accuracy of prediction__ (r) The correlation between the selection criterion, in this
case the phenotypic value, and the true breeding value is known as the
accuracy of prediction.

* __Mid-parent regression__ 

* __Additive genetic variance__ Square of the standard deviation of breeding values. Describe how much the phenotypical variance of a trait in a population can be explained by the relationship of the animals.

* __Standard deviation of breeding values__ ($\sigma_{A})

* __Siblings__ Animals that share the same parents. Half siblings only share half of the parents.

* __Normal distribution__ Describes a probability distribution over the values of a sample of the x-axis. You calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the sample and assume that it is normally distributed. Then you can compute the function over the samples and say that even negative values for body weights are possible. Under the curve the area is in total 1. To assume a normal distribution is comfortable because you can bring all values into an order.

* __Crossproduct__ The same as a matrix multiplication. You always multiply the row elements from left to right of the left matrix with the column top down of the right matrix and sum up the multiplications. Therefore the rows of the left matrix needs the same length as the columns of the right matrix. 

* __Scalarproduct__

* __Kronecker product__ The left matrix determines the structure of the resulting matrix. The elements of the left matrix determine how the elements of the right matrix have to be multiplied and where the multiplied right matrices take their place in the resulting matrix. The resulting matrix always owns the multiplied dimensions of the two matrices.

* __Vector product__ You multiply the first elements together and sum it with the products of the other elements.

* __Matrix transpose__ You change the indication of row and column. The matrix of dimension 2 x 4 turns to a matrix of 4 x 2.

* __Matrix inverse__ Very complex calculation. The inverse multiplied by the non-inverse must result in the identity matrix.

* __Design matrices__ $X_y$ is a matrix that connects the records with the levels of fixed effects. I do not have any fixed effects. Therefore we can assume that $X_y$ is just a vector with the number of values that correspond to the number of records. $Z$ is a design matrix that connects the observations with the breeding values.

* __Residual effects__ The part of phenotypical variance that can not be explained by the random additive genetic effects or the fixed effects.

* __Matrix addition__ You sum all the elements of the same place together. To sum or subtract matrices the need to have exactly the same dimensions.

* __Prediction error variance__ (PEV) is the inverse of the mixed model equations. A diagonal element of PEV is var(u-û). The PEV is considered to be constant in a deterministic breeding plan [@Phocas1996].

* __Economical weights__ (a) Determine the importance of a breeding value for a trait in an aggregate genotype. Unit?

* __Factor of variance reduction__ (k) Factor that estimates the variance reduction due to selection. Defined by the intensity of selection and the value of truncation (defined by the proportion selected).

* __Genetic additive variance-covariance matrix__ (G) An n x n matrix (n=number of traits) owning as diagonal elements the genetic variances of the traits (variances of the breeding values). The non-diagonal elements are the genetic covariances between the traits.

* __Phenotypic variance-covariance matrix__ (V) An n x n matrix (n=number of traits) owning as diagonal elements the phenotypical variances of the traits (variances of the breeding values). The non-diagonal elements are the phenotypical covariances between the traits.

* __Variance-covariance matrix of the residuals__ (R) An n x n matrix (n=number of traits) owning as diagonal elements the residual variances of the traits (variances of the breeding values). The non-diagonal elements are the residual covariances between the traits.

* __Covariance matrix between the true and estimated breeding values of the selection candidate__ (C) An n x n matrix (n=number of traits) that is computed as G - PEV = C.

* __Asymptotic covariance matrix between the true and estimated breeding values of the selection candidate__ (C^*) C that is dependent on the factor of variance reduction.

* __Asymptotic genetic additive variance-covariance matrix__ (G^*) An n x n matrix (n=number of traits) that is dependent on G, asymptotic C and a [Vonrohr1998].

* __Genetic gain__ (deltaG) Often used as synonym for response to selection. In this glossary I defined response to selection differently than genetic gain. Genetic gain is the difference of the mean additive genetic potential expressed in unit of the trait per time unit. You can predict it knowing the selection intensity, the genetic variance and the accuracy of selection of the trait [Presentation Wageningen].

* __Selection index theory__ Used to predict the accuracy of selection. Firs you mimic breeding value estimation using linear regression using genetic parameters of the population of breeding values on phenotypes in a probable scenario. Then you find the regression coefficients (b) and find the accuracy [Presentation Wageningen].
