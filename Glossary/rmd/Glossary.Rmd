## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Lists 
Ther are two types of lists

1. numbered lists
2. unnumbered lists

### numbered lists
Numbered lists start with a number and a dot.

### unnumbered lists
Unnumbered lists start with a star.

* list item
* list item

## formating
Bold face with two __underscores__ or **two stars**.

Italics with one _underscore_ or one *star*.

## Citations
This section explains how we do literature citations together with Mendeley. 

1. First we have to export the *.bib-file for our papers by either
    * setting up automatic *.bib-generation in Mendeley-Desktop via the menu `Mendeley Desktop` > `Preferences` or by
    * explicitly exporting the *.bib file from one paper by right click on the record and hit `Export`
2. As the next step, we copy the *.bib file into the rmd-directory. 
3. The paper can then be cited using the key of the bib-record from the *.bib-file.

For more details see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html

The following text is now citing our paper [@Eriksson2003b]. 

The next paper that we are citing is [@Williams2010a]

# Glossary
* __Net growth__ Mean gain in weight in kg per d. (carcass weight - 0.5 * birth weight) * 1000 / age [@Kunz2018].

* __Carcass weight__ (SG) Phenotypic carcass weight to produce a breeding value carcass weight. The weight data are collected in meat factories by a balance. I contains information about the enviromental and the genetic effects. Heritability of 0.22 for KV and 0.3 for MT show that breeding for carcass weight is possible. Breeding for a specific carcass weight is impossible [@KunzS.2018]. Why? 

* __Early maturity__ Either property of carcass fat coverage (optimum is class 3). Or property, how early an animal can be slaughtered. Should not be mixed up with sexual maturity. However corresponding to Andreas Landolt it may be linked to each other [@Kunz2018].

* __Conformation__ (F) Conformation is determined by the method CH-TAX. It tells you how much meat there is compared to the body weight [@ABZ2017]. 

* __Weaning date__ Date when the calf does not get any milk from its mother anymore.

* __TVD__ Tierverkehrsdatenbank? What information can you find there?

* __carcass category__ Category of different types of carcasses depends on their age, sexual maturity and sex. MT = Bull ungeschaufelt _Was sind Schaufeln?_, MA = Bull older, OB = Ox until 4 Schaufeln, RG = Heifer until 4 Schaufeln, RV = Heifer/ young cow, cow until max 4 Schaufeln, VK = cow, JB = Young heifer, KV = Calf [@ABZ2017]

* __CH-TAX__ Tool to categorize carcasses in different categories. The price of the carcass depends on the category and the carcass weight. C = very well fleshed, H = well fleshed, T = medium fleshed, A = poorly fleshed, X = very poorly fleshed [@ABZ2017].

* __Genetic correlation__ How much are different traits genetically linked to each other. Also called shared heritability. If the term is 0 the traits do not share any heritability with each other. If the term is 1 the traits share all the heritability with each other. Means: If one trait is higher in the next generation, the other will be higher by the same proportion. (proportional to each other). If the term is negative e.g. -1, the proportionality will be negative. If one trait is higher in the next generation the other one will be positive. 

* __Fat coverage__ (FET) There are 5 classes of fat coverages: 1 = non-covered, 2 = partially covered, 3 = evenly covered, 4 = strongly covered, 5 = overfatty [@Kunz2018].

* __Estimation of variance components__ ?

* __Qualität-DB__ ?

* __Pedigree__ Pedigree of the animal. How much data? How far back?

* __Mixed linear model__ Trying to remove effects of the environment on the model by calculating it into the model. Farm is random effekt because there is not enough data to calculate its effect reliably [@Kunz2018].

* __Additive genetic effect__ Has been part of the lecture.

* __Animal model__ Has been part of the lecture.

* __Genetic group__ ?

* __Phantom parents__ ?

* __Basis animal__ Animals in the pedigree that do not have parents according to the model [@Burgisser2018].

* __Bankkalb__ (KV) Watch carcass category

* __Banktier__ (MT) Watch carcass category

* __Selection path__ ?

* __Variance components__ ?

* __Software VCE__ ?

* __Software Mix99__ ?

* __Variances of residuals__ A residual is the vertical difference between a regression line and the observed value. The variance of all residuals or sigma square is the quadratic mean of all residuals

* __Variance__ ($\sigma^2$) Here we use the empiric variance. It is calculated like in this example: We have a number row of 1,3,5,6,8,5. First we sum the values of the row: 1+5+3+6+5+6+8=34. The we divide the sum by the number of numbers: 34/6=5.7. That is the mean. Then we calculate the square differences (absolute) of the observations to the mean/Erwartungswert. Here we do e.g. (1-5.7)^2 = always positive :) ca. . Then we have 9,... 

The computations of the above example can also be done in R-code-chunks as shown below. First, we define a vector called `vec_a` which contains the following numbers

```{r}
vec_a <- c(1,3,5,6,8,5)
```

The sum of the numbers in `vec_a` can be computed as

```{r}
sum(vec_a)
```

The advantage of using R-code-chunks to do the examples is that computations are done automatically and do not lead to errors. Furthermore, we do not have to do computations explicitly, but we can use functions such as `sum` and `mean` which are readily available. 


* __Standard deviation__ Is the mean absolute deviation to the mean of all observations or the Erwartungswert (when stetig). When we calculate a model, we have a line that is stetig, so there we can not just use the mean, but have to define what we mean. Usually we just mean the difference to the line. So to the expectation.

* __Genetic variances__

* __Farm*year variances__

* __Heritability__ ($h^2$) Selection success divided by selection difference (Selektionsintensität). The higher, the more the trait is dependent on the genetics of the population.

* __Rassenkonstante__ 

* __Basis difference__ 

* __Breeding valuation__ (ZWS)

* __Training animal__ Animal with own performance[@Burgisser2018].

* __EBV__ ?

* __Breeding valuation Mutterkuh Schweiz__ ccc = Conformation Bankkälber, cca = Conformation Banktiere, cfc = Fat coverage Bankkälber, cfa = Fat coverage Banktiere, cwc = carcass weight Bankkälber, cwa = carcass weight Banktiere. (c1 = ?, c2 = conformation, f2 = fat coverage, w2 = carcassweight, c3 = calf, a3 = animal)[@Kunz2018]

* __Abbreviations cow breeds__ AN = Angus, AU = Aubrac, BV = Braunvieh, CH = Charolais, LM = Limousin, SM = Simmental [@Kunz2018].

* __Typify__ Genomics not necessary yet.

* __Data validation/selection__ 

* __Breeding valuation carcass traits__ Fat coverage, conformation, carcass weight [@Kunz2018].

* __Breeding valuation early maturity__ Only dependent on age and carcass weight?[@Kunz2018]

* __Fat coverage__ 

* __Meat factory__ Where animals are slaughtered and processed.

* __Degree of freedom__

$$\sigma_{\bar{x_{1}} - \bar{x_{2}}}^2 = \frac {\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}}$$
