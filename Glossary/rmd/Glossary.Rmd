## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Lists 
Ther are two types of lists

1. numbered lists
2. unnumbered lists

### numbered lists
Numbered lists start with a number and a dot.

### unnumbered lists
Unnumbered lists start with a star.

* list item
* list item

## formating
Bold face with two __underscores__ or **two stars**.

## Citations
This section explains how we do literature citations together with Mendeley. 

1. First we have to export the *.bib-file for our papers by either
    * setting up automatic *.bib-generation in Mendeley-Desktop via the menu `Mendeley Desktop` > `Preferences` or by
    * explicitly exporting the *.bib file from one paper by right click on the record and hit `Export`
2. As the next step, we copy the *.bib file into the rmd-directory. 
3. The paper can then be cited using the key of the bib-record from the *.bib-file.

For more details see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html

The following text is now citing our paper [@Eriksson2003b]. 

The next paper that we are citing is [@Williams2010a]

# Glossary
* __Net growth__ Mean gain in weight in kg per d. ( $carcass weight - 0.5 * birth weight) * 1000 / age$ [@Kunz2018].

* __Carcass weight__ (SG) In the case of no legal definition, carcass weight should be defined as the hot weight of both half carcasses after being bled and eviscerated and after removal of skin, removal of external genitalia, the limbs at the carpus and tarsus, head, tail, kidneys and kidney fats and the udder [@ICAR]. 
It is about what ICAR has as definition in the Swiss law [@EDI2013]. Phenotypic carcass weight to produce a breeding value carcass weight. The weight data are collected in meat factories by a balance. It contains information about the enviromental and the genetic effects. Heritability of 0.22 for KV and 0.3 for MT show that breeding for carcass weight is possible. Breeding for a specific carcass weight is impossible. [@KunzS.2018]. The higher the breeding value, the higher the potential carcass weight of the progeny?

* __Early maturity__ Either property of carcass fat coverage (optimum is class 3). Or property, how early an animal can be slaughtered when conditions (no price reductions per kg carcass weight) are met. Often expressed in the unit days. Should not be mixed up with sexual maturity. However corresponding to Andreas Landolt it may be linked to each other [@Kunz2018].

* __Conformation__ (F) Conformation is determined by the method CH-TAX. It tells you how much meat there is compared to the body weight [@ABZ2017]. 

* __Weaning date__ Date when the calf does not get any milk from its mother anymore.

* __Tierverkehrsdatenbank__ (TVD) There all animals are given a unique ID and informations about phenotypic performance, breeding values and relationship degrees are conserved. Identitas AG is owner of the data in Switzerland.

* __Carcass category__ Category of different types of carcasses depends on their age, sexual maturity and sex. MT = Bull ungeschaufelt _Was sind Schaufeln?_, MA = Bull older, OB = Ox until 4 Schaufeln, RG = young bull until 4 Schaufeln, RV = young bull/ young cow, cow until max 4 Schaufeln, VK = cow, JB = Young bull, KV = Calf [@ABZ2017]

* __CH-TAX__ Tool to categorize visually carcasses in different categories, it describes the trait carcass conformation. The price of the carcass depends on the category and the carcass weight. C = very well fleshed, H = well fleshed, T = medium fleshed, A = poorly fleshed, X = very poorly fleshed [@ABZ2017].

* __Genetic correlation__ How much are different traits genetically linked to each other. Also called shared heritability. If the term is 0 the traits do not share any heritability with each other. If the term is 1 the traits share all the heritability with each other. Means: If one trait is higher in the next generation, the other will be higher by the same proportion. (proportional to each other). If the term is negative e.g. -1, the proportionality will be negative. If one trait is higher in the next generation the other one will be positive. 

* __Carcass fat coverage__ (FET) There are 5 classes of fat coverages: 1 = non-covered, 2 = partially covered, 3 = evenly covered, 4 = strongly covered, 5 = overfatty. The higher the breeding value of FET, the higher potentially the fat class of its offspring [@KunzS.2018].

* __Estimation of variance components__ Enables the calculation of heritabilities https://qualitasag.ch/neu-im-juli-2018-update-zuchtwertschaetzung-schlachtmerkmale/. Usually with a sample. You have multiple phenotypic values per farm, then you can calculate the variance (of the same animal?) accross different year over the same farm, you can calculate the variance of a estimator in the slaughterhouse per animal?.

* __Qualität-DB__ ?

* __Pedigree__ Pedigree of the animal[@VonRohr2017]. A tabulation of ids and names of an individual’s ancestors. Pedigree information is used to establish genetic relationships among individuals to use in genetic evaluations [@ICAR]. 

* __Mixed linear model__ Trying to remove effects of the environment on the model by calculating it into the model. Farm is random effekt because there is not enough data to calculate its effect reliably [@Kunz2018].

* __Additive genetic effect__ The effect of the genetics of an animal that are inherited to its offspring. Not included is the dominance and epistasy effect [@VonRohr2017].

* __Animal model__ Is a version of BLUP, where the phenotypic observation of an animal depends on the breeding value of the animal and the breeding value of the animal is dependent on the breeding values of all its relatives. Also the breeding value is corrected by the breeding value of its mating partners [@VonRohr2017].

* __Genetic groups__ Groups of animals with unknown parents. Groups are formed according to age (year born), country of origin and/or breed composition (if more than one breed is included) [@ICAR]. Example and purpose?

* __Phantom parents__ ?

* __Basis animal__ Animals in the pedigree that do not have parents according to the model?? [@Burgisser2018]. Or: One of the animals that create as their mean the population mean. E.G. In the german breeding valuation the animals from 2006-2010 are used to calculate the population mean for the breeding values 2014. They change each year in Germany [@Vit].

* __Bankkalb__ (KV) Watch carcass category. Why differentiate breeding values of KV and MT?

* __Banktier__ (MT) Watch carcass category

* __Selection path__ ?

* __Variance components__ ?

* __Software VCE__ ?

* __Software Mix99__ ?

* __Residual__ A residual is the vertical difference between a regression line and the observed value. 

* __Variance__ ($\sigma^2$) Here we use the empiric variance. It is calculated like in this example: We have a number row (vector) of:
```{r}
vec_a <- c(1,3,5,6,8,5)
```
We take the arithmetic mean out of the vector values:
```{r}
mvec_a <- mean(vec_a)
mvec_a
```
We calculate the square differences (absolute) of the observations to the mean/Erwartungswert.
```{r}
sdvec_a <- (mvec_a-vec_a)^2
sdvec_a
```
We take the sum of the square differences and divide it by the degrees of freedom which is the number of terms in the vector - 1.
```{r}
sum(sdvec_a)/(length(vec_a)-1)

```
Should be the same like
```{r}
var(vec_a)
```

The advantage of using R-code-chunks to do the examples is that computations are done automatically and do not lead to errors. Furthermore, we do not have to do computations explicitly, but we can use functions such as `sum` and `mean` which are readily available. 

* __Standard deviation__ It is usually calculated as the square root of the variance. It is the mean absolute deviation to the mean of all observations or the Erwartungswert (when stetig) [@Kalisch2011]. Like in the example of variance:

```{r}
var_vec_a <- var(vec_a)
stdev<- var_vec_a^0.5
stdev
```

* __Genetic variances__ Phenotypic variances that can be explained by the genetics of the animal (by its pedigree) [@VonRohr2017].

* __Farm*year variances__ Phenotypic variances that can be explained by the environment (of which data is available like farm and year) of the animal. Different feed, managents, location [@Hospenthal2016].

* __Heritability__ ($h^2$) Selection success divided by selection difference (Selektionsintensität). The higher, the more the trait is dependent on the genetics of the population [@VonRohr2017].

* __Basis difference__ ? 

* __Breeding valuation__ (ZWS) Traditionally we use informations about phenotypic performances and degrees of relationships to estimate the breeding value.Now informations about the genetics of an animal can also be used [@VonRohr2017]. Also called genetic evaluation [@ICAR].

* __Training animal__ Animal with own performance[@Burgisser2018].

* __Abbreviations Breeding valuation Mutterkuh Schweiz__ ccc = Conformation Bankkälber, cca = Conformation Banktiere, cfc = Fat coverage Bankkälber, cfa = Fat coverage Banktiere, cwc = carcass weight Bankkälber, cwa = carcass weight Banktiere. (c1 = ?, c2 = conformation, f2 = fat coverage, w2 = carcassweight, c3 = calf, a3 = animal) [@Kunz2018].

* __Abbreviations cow breeds__ AN = Angus, AU = Aubrac, BV = Braunvieh, CH = Charolais, LM = Limousin, SM = Simmental [@Kunz2018].

* __Typify__ Genomics not necessary yet.

* __Data validation/selection__ Making sure that the data is describing what we want to look at and deciding which data will be used for further analysis.

* __Estimated breeding value__ (EBV) EBVs are expressed in the units of measurement for each particular trait.  They are shown as + ive or - ive differences between an individual animal's genetics difference and the genetic base to which the animal is compared.  For example, a bull with an EBV of +50 kg for 600-Day Weight is estimated to have genetic merit 50 kg above the breed base of 0 kg.  Since the breed base is set to an historical benchmark, the average EBVs of animals in each year drop has changed over time as a result of genetic progress within the breed.
The absolute value of any EBV is not critical, but rather the differences in EBVs between animals.  Particular animals should be viewed as being "above or below breed average" for a particular trait.   http://abri.une.edu.au/online/pages/understanding_ebvs_char.htm

* __Breeding valuation carcass traits__ Fat coverage, conformation, carcass weight [@Kunz2018].

Animals with different subcutaneus carcass fatness then not comparable? Comes from concept residual feed intake Sitzung 23.8.17.

* __Residual feed intake__ 

* __Beef herdbook__ (FLHB) The FLHB a part of Mutterkuh Schweiz. Its goal is to achieve genetic and economic improvements in suckle cow husbandry by collecting and analysing data for breeding [@FLHB2017].

The visual assessment of an animal for one or more morphological characteristics using a linear scale which represents the biological extremes in the population of animals under consideration [@ICAR].

* __Population mean of breeding value__ ($\mu$) Lies usually at 100, when relative breeding values are used. It is calculated as the mean of the basis animals. If an animal has a breeding value over 100 its offspring has the potential to be on average better in this trait than the average population [@KunzS.2018].
