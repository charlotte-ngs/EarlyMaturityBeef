## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Lists 
Ther are two types of lists

1. numbered lists
2. unnumbered lists

### numbered lists
Numbered lists start with a number and a dot.

### unnumbered lists
Unnumbered lists start with a star.

* list item
* list item

## formating
Bold face with two __underscores__ or **two stars**.

Italics with one _underscore_ or one *star*.


## Citations
This section explains how we do literature citations together with Mendeley. 

1. First we have to export the *.bib-file for our papers by either
    * setting up automatic *.bib-generation in Mendeley-Desktop via the menu `Mendeley Desktop` > `Preferences` or by
    * explicitly exporting the *.bib file from one paper by right click on the record and hit `Export`
2. As the next step, we copy the *.bib file into the rmd-directory. 
3. The paper can then be cited using the key of the bib-record from the *.bib-file.

For more details see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html

The following text is now citing our paper [@Eriksson2003b]. 

The next paper that we are citing is [@Williams2010a]
