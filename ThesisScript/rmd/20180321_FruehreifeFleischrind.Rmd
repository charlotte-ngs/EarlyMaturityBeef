## Background

Up until summer 2018, the Swiss beef cattle breeders association has been focusing their genetic evaluations mainly on growth rate and carcass conformation. 
Lately it has been observed that carcass fat is decreasing at least for some beef cattle breeds, which leads to a price reduction of the carcass [@Hospenthal2016].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Vergleich der Fettklasse 2014 - 2017"}

knitr::include_graphics("Trend_CarcassFat.png")
```


Several stakeholders derive from the decreasing levels of carcass fat that Swiss beef cattle does not show any improvements in the trait early maturity. 

Protein deposition increases linearly with increasing body weight, but lipid deposition increases exponentially with increasing body weight (Figure 21.3 Thonney) [@Thonney2015].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Chemical components in the empty body (gut contents removed) of 49 beef steers. (From the data of Haecker, 1920.) [@Thonney2015]"}

knitr::include_graphics("Bildschirmfoto.png")
```


Until 300 kg body weight the weight of protein is higher, then the weight of lipids is higher [@Thonney2015].
The heavier the animal the higher the proportion of fat tissue in comparison to muscle tissue and bone tissue [@Thonney2015].
Fat deposition is therefore usually the limiting factor for early maturity during growth [@Thonney2015].

Early maturity is of high economical importance because a lower age at slaughter leads to less costs for the farmer and less negative impacts on the environment [@Berry2017] (decreased feed and environment efficiency).

### Early maturity
Terms rooting on the word mature can be confusing. 
The "rate of maturation" describes the amount of time until the adult weight is reached and the "degree of maturity" describes the proportion of the current weight to the adult weight [@Thonney2015]. 
This would lead to the definition used in trout breeding that early maturity is the amount of time until the adult weight is reached [@Kause2014].

Early maturity ("Frühreife") in this context however is defined as the amount of time until an animal meets the necessary requirements (within its category?) to be slaughtered without any price reductions per kg of carcass weight.

### CHTAX

Price reductions are dependent on the price formation process of the slaughterhouse.

Since 1994 Swiss slaughterhouses value beef cattle based on the classification system CHTAX [Kaufmann1995]. 
The first step of valuation is placing the animal in the correct category. The distinct categories differ in physiological age at slaughter, sex and weight. 
Within each category the animal is visually classified in five classes of carcass fat (Tabelle) and carcass conformation (Bild).
When the animal does not belong to the optimal class of carcass fat (3) or the maximal class of carcass conformation (C) the price per carcass weight is reduced.

### Pricing
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
Gewicht <- 200
C3 <- 9.55
H4 <- 7.9 - 0.9
ErloesC3<-Gewicht * C3
ErloesH4<- Gewicht * H4
```


For example the price of a young bull (MT) of `r Gewicht` kg carcass weight is `r ErloesC3`.- Swiss Francs (SFr) when in the most favoured classes of carcass conformation and carcass fat and `r ErloesH4`.- SFr when in the least favoured classes [@Proviande2018]. 


### Meat quality indicators

Carcass fat and carcass conformation have been introduced as price formation factors, because they coincide with important price-determining characteristics of beef meat [@Kaufmann1995]. 
Carcass fat when to low is related to poor tenderness, juiciness and palatability, when too high with increased trimming effort for the slaughterhouse[@Kaufmann1995].

A better carcass conformation in turn leads to a high exploitation of valuable meat pieces [@Proviande2015].

### Breeding strategy

In Summer 2018 carcass fat has joined carcass conformation and carcass weight to the existing multi-trait breeding valuation model carcass caracteristics.
The first results of the routine breeding value estimation for carcass fat have been published in summer 2018.
At the moment the trait carcass fat is used to derive the trait early maturity [@Kunz2018].






# Annex

Also there is the breed Limousin which underperforms in carcass fat. 
Nevertheless offspring of Limousin sires are most prevalent in the favoured category of carcass conformation C3. 
This shows that for breeding you should always combine the two traits carcass conformation and carcass fat [@Hospenthal2016]. 

Commercial cattle are generally determined as ready for slaughter by visual inspection of the degree of fatness within the appropriate range of live weight [@VanGroningen2006].

Carcass conformation correlates with carcass fat by about 0.31. 
Age at slaughter correlates positiveley with carcass fat but not linear (concave with decreasing slope) [@Hospenthal2016].

The proportion of weight to adult body weight (asymptotic weight) is degree of maturity [@Thonney2015].

The older the animal the higher the proportion of fat tissue in comparison to muscle tissue and bone tissue [@Thonney2015].

Most selection for growth changed the growth curve by decreasing or increasing adult size. 
Selection rareley changed the shape of the growth curve or the underlying biological relationships between growth and body composition [@Thonney2015].

Weights across different ages are highly correlated. Growth rates at given age are generally related to adult size [@Thonney2015].

The higher the age at slaughter of an animal is the higher is the impact of genetics on the beef carcass traits [@Englishby2017].

In Ireland the usually cross crossbred suckler cows to purebred beef sires. 
Also they use an multi-trait across breed animal model. There they include 15 traits including carcass weight and carcass fat. 
The heritability is 0.31 for carcass fat [@Evans2007].

In Switzerland the "Bundesamt für Landwirtschaft" has to determine the methods to classify carcasses of ruminants. 
The criteria are the age at slaughter, the carcass conformation and the carcass fat [@Bundesrat2002].

In order to get no selling price reductions they have to feed their animals for a longer time, when their animals do not mature early. 
However, in Switzerland the carcass should not weight too much. More than 290 kg carcass weight for MT will result in a price discount of at least 0.1.-/kg carcass weight [@Proviande2018].

### CHTAX

The beef meat market in Switzerland is controlled by the sector association "Proviande". Proviande employees classify beef carcasses in large-scale slaughterhouses to determine their price. 
Their classification is based on the classification system CH-TAX [@Proviande2015] and is carried out as follows:

1. The category of the carcass is defined by physiological age at slaughter, sex and carcass weight (Own table according to table on page 5, Proviande2015). 
When weighted the carcass should be already trimmed as shown in this figure [@EDI2013, S.1].

2. The carcass is visually classified for carcass conformation and carcass fat. 
Carcass conformation describes how meaty the carcass is and carcass fat describes how fat the carcass is.

3. The price of the carcass is estimated. For carcass conformation the price is maximal at the end of the scale (C) and for carcass fat at the center of the scale (3).

In Switzerland beef carcasses are generally much smaller than abroad in order to fulfill the wishes of the market. 
Therefore beef cattle in Switzerland has to mature earlier than abroad [@Hospenthal2016]. 

## Rate of maturation derived from carcass fat (Noch nicht überarbeitet)

Early maturity is a complex and not directly measurable trait which complicates breeding for it. 
One possibility is to derive this trait from an already recorded closely correlated trait. 

Carcass fat has been chosen because of two reasons. 
First it is being routineley collected in slaughterhouses since 1994 [@Kaufmann1995]. 
Second correlation is given by the fact that "cattle growth and body composition are inextricably linked" [@Thonney2015]. 
Protein increases linearly with increasing body weight, but lipid deposition increases exponentially with increasing body weight (Figure 21.3 Thonney) [@Thonney2015].
Until 300 kg body weight the deposition of protein is higher, then the deposition of lipids is higher [@Thonney2015].
This shows that over time carcass fat is generally the limiting factor to meet the requirements to be slaughtered.

Generally cattle gain weight as slightly sigmoid shaped curve (Fig. 21.1) which means that the weight gain is decreasing with increasing age. 
The adult weight is defined as the asymptotic weight of the growth curve. 
Cattle that is higher in carcass fat at a given carcass weight has higher adult weights (Figure 21.4) . 
As the adult weight decreases the growth rate generally decreases aswell at a given weight [@Thonney2015].
It has been tried to resolve the negative correlation between growth rate and rate of maturation, but often unsuccessful.

## Rate of maturation as index trait

To prevent that you can also choose to combine carcass weight, carcass conformation and carcass fat to one index which then is called early maturity. 
To act at best reasons to improve the income of beef cattle producers you should weight the different traits in the index according to their economic value to the cattle producers [@Englishby2017].
