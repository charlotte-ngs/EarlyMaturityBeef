aim: To compute genetic gain for carcass fat (CF) in an univariate case.

# Genetic gain

I computed the genetic gain of the breeding value carcass fat using the formula derived from @Phocas1998. 

$$Q = \frac {ir^*\sigma^*}{L}$$
\begin{equation}
\label{GeneticGain}
Q = \frac {ir^*\sigma^*}{L}
\end{equation}

$i$ is the selection intensity.

$L$ is the generation intervall in years.

$r^*$ is the asymptotic accuracy of the of the breeding value of the selection candidate.

$\sigma^*$ is the asymptotic standard deviation of the breeding value.

$^*$ = indicates that asymptotic reduction of variance during selection has been taken into account in the computations [@Bulmer1971].

In the following sections I will describe how I computed the variables to get the value of genetic gain in \autoref{GeneticGain}

## Selection intensity {#SelInt}

I computed the selection intensity from the assumed proportion (p) of selected animals using the R-command `dnorm(qnorm(1-p))/p`.
The proportion of selected animals is the share of animals born that will be parents of the next generation.
I could use this computation method, because I assumed normal distribution of phenotypes and genotypes in the population (Hier Peter als Quelle, oder Lehrbuch?).


## Generation intervall

The generation intervall describes how often selection occurs.
There are no genomic breeding values for carcass traits available yet in Switzerland.
Progeny records are important to get sufficient accuracies of traditional breeding values.
Therefore beef cattle breeders usually wait for progeny records until they select the parents of the next generation.
The waiting time from birth to selection determines the generation intervall. 
Here the generation intervall is the mean age of selection candidates at which records of their progeny are available.
I use Sophie's reference value.

## Accuracy

I computed the asymptotic accuracy $r^*$ with the equation derived from @Phocas1998.
$$r^*=\sqrt{\frac {C^*}{(\sigma^*)^2}}$$

$C_y^*$ is the asymptotic covariance between true and estimated breeding value of the selection candidate before the selection. 
The computations of $C_y^*$ and $\sigma^*$ are present in section \ref(StdevUniv).

## Standard deviation {#StdevUniv} 

I used the following formula derived from Phocas@1998 to compute the asymptotic standard deviation $\sigma^*$ of the breeding value.

$$\sigma^*=\sqrt{\sigma_g^2-kC^*}$$

$k$ is the factor of variance reduction.

$\sigma_g$ is the genetic standard deviation of the trait in the population.

I computed $k$ by the R-command `i * (i - qnorm(p))` using the selection intensity (i) \ref(SelInt) and the proportion selected (p) (Hier Peter als Quelle?).


@Kunz2018 has computed $\sigma_g$ which is available in table ??.

### Covariance between true and estimated breeding value

The tedious part was to compute the asymptotic covariance between true and estimated breeding value $C^*$.
Again I derived the necessary equations from @Phocas1998.
$$C^*=\frac{C}{1+0.5k} $$

$C$ is the non-asymptotic covariance between true and estimated breeding value.

I computed $C$ using the equation
$$C=\sigma_g^2-PEV$$

$PEV$ is the prediction error variance of the breeding value.

### Prediction error variance

I computed $PEV$ using the equation.
The $PEV$ needs to be a number for the previous equations.
In the following equation $PEV$ is a $j$ x $j$ matrix where $j$ is the number of breeding values.
Therefore I take only the part of the PEV-matrix that belongs to the selection candidate, which is one element of the matrix.

$$
PEV=(Z^TR^{-1}Z+A^{-1}(\sigma_g^2)^{-1})^{-1}
$$

$A$ is the relationship matrix of the selection candidate.

$Z$ is a design matrix connecting the records with the breeding values.

$R$ is the residual variance matrix for the recorded animals.

### Relationship and design matrices

I computed the relationship matrix $A$ using the R-package `pedigreemm`.
$A$ is dependent on the number and type of records available to compute the breeding value of the selection candidate.
I assumed a scenario of $y$ progeny records for the selection candidate (based on?).
The dimension of $A$ is $y+1$ x $y+1$, where $+1$ indicates the selection candidate. 

$Z$ is a $y$ x $y+1$ dimensional matrix with values of 0 or 1.
I computed $Z$ with the R command `cbind(matrix(0, nrow=pr,ncol=1),diag(pr))`.

### Residual variance matrix

$R$ is a diagonal matrix with the residual variance $\sigma_r^2$ as diagonal elements.
I computed $R$ with the equation

$$R=\sigma_r^2I_n$$

$\sigma_r^2$ is the residual variance of the trait in the population.

$I_n$ is an identity matrix of dimension $n$, where $n$ = number of records = number of progeny of the selection candidate (See table???).

@Kunz2018 has computed $\sigma_r^2$ synchronically with $\sigma_g^2$ (see table??)
