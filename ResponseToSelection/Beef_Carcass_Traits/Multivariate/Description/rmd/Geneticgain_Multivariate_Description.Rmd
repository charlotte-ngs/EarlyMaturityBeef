# Target / Zweck

Informing how the genetic gain for carcass traits has been computed.

# Plan / Principle

Start from the result of the computations. Tell why the result is important and what the basic thoughts behind the computations are. Then explain the main equations.

# Material

* Skript "Geneticgain_CarcassTraits_Multivariate"

* Skript "ResponseToSelection"

* Skript "02-matandmeth"

# Implementation

In this project breeding strategies should be evaluated in their effectiveness to improve early maturity.
This evaluation requires certain tools, which help to rank the breeding strategies.
A particularly powerful tool is the value of genetic gain.
This value provides information about a trait's mean improvement over a period of time in a population.
Thus it allows to rank different breeding strategies in their effectiveness.

The genetic gain should predict the future as precise as possible.
Its value dependends on the breeding conditions in a population and the type of its computation.
The breeding conditions are defined by the generation intervall $L$, the accuracy of the breeding value $r$, the genetic standard deviation of the trait $\sigma_{g}$ and the selection intensity $i$.
They are derived from the past breeding situation.
The type of computation is derived from the approach of @Phocas1996.

There, the so-called Bulmer-Effect [@Bulmer??] is considered.
