# Target / Zweck

Informing how the genetic gain for carcass traits has been computed.

# Plan / Principle

Start from the result of the computations. Tell why the result is important and what the basic thoughts behind the computations are. Then explain the main equations.

# Material

* Skript "Geneticgain_CarcassTraits_Multivariate"

* Skript "ResponseToSelection"

* Skript "02-matandmeth"

# Implementation

## Target
In this project breeding strategies should be evaluated in their effectiveness to improve early maturity.
This evaluation requires certain tools, which help to characterize the breeding strategies.
A particularly powerful tool is the value of genetic gain.
This value provides information about a trait's or index's mean genetic improvement over a period of time in a population.
Here, the genetic gain of the trait carcass fat and the index over carcass traits has been computed.

# Principle

The genetic gain ($Q$) achieved in one generation is the product of the intensity of selection ($i$), the square root of the accuracy of the breeding value ($r$) and the genetic variance ($\sigma_{g}$).
This can be written as

\begin{equation}
\label{Qgeneration}
Q = ir\sigma_{g}
\end{equation}
$$Q = ir\sigma_{g}$$


The breeding conditions are defined by the generation intervall $L$, the accuracy of the breeding value $r$, the genetic standard deviation of the trait $\sigma_{g}$ and the selection intensity $i$.
They are derived from the past breeding situation.
The type of computation is derived from the approach of @Phocas1996.

There, the so-called Bulmer-Effect [@Bulmer??] is considered.
