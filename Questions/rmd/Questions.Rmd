## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Formating rules

* Questions That is how you format questions.
    * Answers That is how you format answers.

## Questions / Answers

* Why do breeding values not have a unit? In this video they have a unit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JxcTELevoc.
    *
    
* How do you calculate the total breeding value at the moment?
    *

* How big is the basis population at the moment. How could I find out myself?
    *
    
* How should I format the glossary so you could help me to get rid of my mistakes?
    *
    
* How do you validate your data?
    *
    
* Why do you do the breeding valuation separateley for Calves (KV) and Heifers (MT) and seperateley for each breed?
    *

* At the moment you are breeding carcass conformation to C, carcass weight to maximum and carcass fat coverage to maximum, don't you?
    *
    
* Should I call Fettabdeckung carcass fat or carcass fat coverage?
    *
    
* The big disadvantage of the introduction of carcass fat coverage as a breeding value is, that current animals can not be compared to past animals, isnt' it?
    *

* The big advantage of the introduction of carcass fat coverage as a breeding value is, that breeders can now breed organised towards more carcass fat coverage, which has generally declined over years, isn't it?
    *
    
* For Calves (KV) carcass fat coverage negativeley correlates with conformation, for beef it is the opposite, how can this be?
    *
    
* Is the accuracy of breeding values the same as the certainty of breeding values?
    *
    
* What is ASR F&E? Found in notice of meeting 16.5.
    *
    
* Somehow I could never really understand what the degrees of freedom means. Could you please give me a simple explanation?
    *
    
* Is it a good idea to look at breeding methods of other animal species to compare it to beef cattle?
    *
    
* Can you give an example for each why you choose a variable to be a random effect or a fixed effect?
    *
