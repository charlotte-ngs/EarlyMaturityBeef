## Disclaimer
There is a conceptual error in the computation of economic values for carcass weight in `r mrmt$add("Wyss2019")`. This error is analysed and some correction measures are proposed.


## Economic Values
Economic values are defined as change in profit ($\Delta T$) caused by a small change in the mean level of a trait in a given population. In [@Wyss2019] econcomic values are computed with a simplified version of a profit function. Profit ($T$) is computed as gross revenue ($R$) minus costs ($C$)

$$T = R - C$$

Due to above mentioned simplification, the costs $C$ were assumed to be constant. Hence any change in $T$ was assumed to be caused completely by changes in $R$.
