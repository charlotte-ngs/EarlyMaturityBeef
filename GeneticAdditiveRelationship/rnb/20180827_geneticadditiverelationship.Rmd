We can compute the genetic additive relationship matrix $A$ for a given pedigree using the `pedigreemm` package.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages( library(pedigreemm) )
nNrAni <- 5
ped <- pedigree(sire = c(NA,NA,1,1,3), dam = c(NA,NA,2,2,4), label = 1:nNrAni)
print(ped)
```

The function `getA` computes the additive relationship matrix

```{r}
getA(ped)
```

The inverse is computed as 

```{r}
getAInv(ped)
```
